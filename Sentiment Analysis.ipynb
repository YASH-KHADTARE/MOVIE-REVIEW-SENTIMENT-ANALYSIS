       "'guys listen to me While youre milking this already please add some tech to it and connect it to cyberpunk somehow I know its a challange but I believe you can do it You turned this into some sort of raging rambo movie so lets go all the way crazy lets even connect it to halo somehow and doom too never forget about doombredit imagine keanu reeves as quotthe slayerquot lt and that explains why they send quotonly himquot against all the evil lolWhat else do you want to see in a movie like every one has fun tearing and downsizing movies this movie has all the potential small on dialogue but detailed and explodes through cerography Just an observationOn a constellation note its no coincidence it happens to be the lions gate portal What it reminds me you know when you get to boss level the opponets tend to get a little tougher I mean john wick just kicks ass could not be better than keanu reeves the gentle breeze the one the power withing the virgo playing this he must of worked his ass off it showsMust of watched john wick a hunndred times all day long I watched number I kept seeing sunrises like constantly for a few days now I know its directly tied into this movie So golden Iove and adore the nunchucku scene So beautifulI really loved character of caine hes one of the best Ive ever seen yetGood videosGreat Movie Just finish this whoever this Table shit is this high table just gets on my nervesI just watched John Wick last night and i was blown away on how good it was Most franchises get terrible after the second film but this one just got better and better The plots got more intricate each baddy was better than the previous one every new character introduced whether a small or large part was superbly done by the actor and the fight scenes just got better and better Now we all knew that this was to be the last John Wick film but WOW what a final twist to the John Wick character Who would have seen that coming I tip my hat to all of those involved in the making of this amazing film franchiseLEMBRANDO QUE RONALD REAGAN PERSEGUIU OS PRODUTORES DE FILME DE HOLLYWOOD IGUAL NA POCA DA INQUISIO PERSEGUIU OS YAUDINS FILHOS DE DEUS RONALD REAGAN NAZISTALEMBRANDO QUE RONALD REAGAN PERSEGUIU OS PRODUTORES DE FILME DE HOLLYWOOD IGUAL NA POCA DA INQUISIO PERSEGUIU OS YAUDINS FILHOS DE DEUS RONALD REAGAN NAZISTALEMBRANDO QUE RONALD REAGAN PERSEGUIU OS PRODUTORES DE FILME DE HOLLYWOOD IGUAL NA POCA DA INQUISIO PERSEGUIU OS YAUDINS FILHOS DE DEUS RONALD REAGAN NAZISTAI dont get it The movie sucked hrs of a guy with an endless round clip fighting nonstop and killing or hundred guys BoringBoringWatching JW to JW is intense yet fascinating how the story evolved and the casts are magnificent This action movie is once in a lifetime roled and molded to be the most outstanding ever Great Job to you allI dont think any movie series demonstrates style over substance like the Wick franchise The first one was a lot of fun and well done After that its just been highly stylized ultra choreographed fight scenes that find new ways to kill people JW takes that yet another level with axes arrows bladed of all kinds incendiary rounds etc etc Theres literally no plot other than same plot he has to work his way up the food chain of bad guys to be freebrbrSome of the visuals are outstanding and entertaining some were clunky and some poor CGI showed itself I found the blind swordsmen trope ruined by this movie and the need for the suspension of disbelief turned to max to keep watching it From all that youd think I didnt like this moviebrbrIn the genre of mindless ultra violent fun over the top fight scenes its a good movie Fans of the franchise will not be disappointed Im over those kinda of movies at this point and I think in the genre of utterly over the top ultra violent movies with great and I do mean great amazing fight scenes yet has humor character development etc done for a fraction of the cost Hardcore Henry is my pickbrbrAs to John Wick seen one you seen em all but those who like the franchise AThis movie is so underratedI have watched this movie in the theatreIt is just awesomeIs that the guy from bill and tedTrailer was good film was absolute shitIt wasnt the end I am sure that Jonh Wick also will be And in this grave was buried Johns love to his wife Helen John Wick you do not have any right to die It is too soon for you Wait for you ManBought john wick best action movieHey producer keep the Belgian M PleaseIf you do a fifth movie please let it be a prequel of the original film showing a younger Wick that still works for Viggo at his primeIs it me or John has gone rusty brSo many scenes it was like watching my grandfather fighting lol sorry but I think the fighting movies are definitely not for himI have repeated watching this now timesShould be called quotJohn WOKE quot because they put a black person in it its because of woke agenda that only donald trump can stop We must save america VOTE TRUMP and END WOKENESSi dont like kannue rreves to meet chris d eliabrlike if i like john wick i wont like any other films in actionIve only got one thing to say about JWYeahWas quite surprised theyd use quotThe Warriors quot radio scene to duplicate and use on JW to inform Hunters of JW location and progressMy review is as follows Keanu Reeves plays his part very well but the scenes in this movie seem as if they were thought out by unprofessional child directors John Wick was beaten like Kunta in Roots yet nothing was broken He jumped out of a story building crushing the car he landed on top of and bounced off of it hitting the pavement of the street yet he got right up and walked away and went to McDonalds to order a Happy Meal The suits were bulletproof but knives could easily penetrate them It was the same way with the assassin crew that came in dressed in black armor as well When Mr Wick fought and was shooting at the gold toothed Mafia Boss Scott Adkins in the middle of the nightclub everyone just kept dancing like absolutely nothing was going on because continuing to dance was more important than watching someone being killed I could go on and on and on and on with all of the land of make believe BS this movie had in it I mean lets be real the man was hit by cars at a very high rate of speed and still got up and kept fighting REALLY This was not thought through at all Whoever composed this would be better off designing video games for PlayStation The dog was the best actor throughout the entire movieAppreciating Bill Skarsgard he did a phenomenal job hes underrated in this movieHaha Warriors rip off this is the first film I have watched that has paid homage to the great Warriors film from the sMe favHow much money they spent on making this piece of crap What a horrible moviebrGlad he died at the end This way there wont be any more sequels OoofI just watched the movie last nightLMB at Bothead ReviewsJohn Wick Chapter brbrbrquotHasta la vista babyquot Terminator Judgment Daywhy does john have to dieJohn Wick feels like watching a video gamebrHe just cant die no matter howi love JohnI was impressed they were able to keep me connected with Parabellum It just seems to get diluted and watered down afterAnd the cake takes blind man with a sword who killed other swordsmen and dodged bulletsIm not sure which movie this people watched Movie is disappointing no good storyline as previous just nonsense fights and one of those where he swings and hirs of them and yet when shooting they r alive and still fighting after receiving bullets and cinematic its cut during the fight u can tell by stalling or forwarding secI loved the first film the best in the franchise in my opinion The franchise has run its course gave us a satisfying farewell to John Wick Time to move on to the interesting looking prequel tv series The ContinentalThis is the only wick I have been disappointed in very unbelievable assassin suck ass endingNext level movie in

angle to first person perspective It may take a while yet but shit like that is coming and I cant waitmusicThe first Osaka fight scene arent realistic also its kinda boring and too long While Keanu Reeves did pretty good job at fighting but blind man japanese fighters and the others ruined this Seems like theyre fighting but they dont touch the opponent I was thinking it should be better than

quotBaby baby baby ohquotbrI thought youd always be mine mineSame old same O and the ending was terrible What a disappointmentOne of the worst films ive ever seenIf they do a John wick please dont put the rock in itThey should of stopped after Chapter This movie really stretches credibility to the impossible Wick and most of the other combatants get shot many many times to NO effect I get how their suits are a kevlar weave but seriously To be that effective theyd have to be wearing Ironmans armour And a blind assassin Keanus acting is very wooden Always has been But no new dialogue at all quoti need a gunquot At nearly yrs of age Keanu is still reasonably competent at the handtohand fighting stunts But he was noticably less so in this movie Pleaseno more sequels Count your money guys and be happy OH the best character had to beScott Adkins Wearing a fat suit and still kicking the shit out of Wick He looked like he really enjoyed himselfHe dodges bulletCant tell how restless I am for JW since last three months I couldnt go to the theatre for some reason Waiting now for its ott arrivalbrbrSince last half a year Ive been working out hard in the morning consistently and trying to mimic JWs everything about his personality whether its his mannerism the style of walking or the way he always manages to speak less wasting no words Being polite and aggressive as per the need of the

isAwesomeA dumb movie to pay for I know its a wick flick but its stupidOnly one question needed answering for me just how was Wick not dead from the end of Shot to the head falls off a roof cracks his head and neck on a dumpster at the bottomit is simply not possible to recover from that so they ignore it Some weak nod to Fishburne is not enough and that blemishes the movie from the start as there are no real physical consequences for John The guy shouldnt be walking yet after the end of the original let alone this so that ruins the movie from the start Too bad but they shouldnt have ended Parabellum so viciously and enough with dogs on command as killers in these films too He had a sweet puppy of hope not a grown KP partner in the original Its insulting to see how much the love of a dog and his redemption has been tarnished here As for blind men with guns and how they get around in new places with gunfire everywhere not even Donnie Yen is that good Glad I got to watch this for free I sure wouldnt have paid much for itDont even bother with this movie Wicks big nemesis in this movie is a BLIND man What a jokeCurrently watching the movie The Osaka guards using bows arrowsand swords against gunmen is akin to Perry massacring the Samaria in the The scene is dumbbrbrEdit yall are lucky Keanu took the Wick roll so seriously and outshines your dumber ideas for the film Do

like the homageKeanu Reeves Donnie Yen Ian McShane Fishburne Halle Berry are the best actors you could have put in John Wick and easily made it a solid entertaining fun film Every single chapter was so fun to watch filled with action and creative kills you just hope dont end Keanu Reeves just speechless over his incredible performance everytime which just gets better as the next John Wick releases The cast was the best picks and had they been other actors it would not be as big and popular as it is just wow JW blew my high expectations out the window the movie is the best action movie I have seen since JW Brilliant all around and to everyone included in making this masterpiece this is a movie everybody remembers years ahead and it is so impressive that each chapter has been thoroughly entertaining throughout there is no bad John Wick movie This is a must watchEverybody wants to know if he died or not Its very simple the begining its the end And the end its the begining good for you mr regizorJohn wick dies sorry spoilersBro If you know Donnie hes IP MANI want as many John Wick movies as there are fast and furious moviesFor the first time in my life I fell asleep watching an action movie br fighting and gunfighting scenes are extremely stupid Elite Table soldiers cannot fight and cannot shoot Behave the same plastic dolls for beating br guns duel with blind person beyond stupidity as well Best killer in the world shooting worse than blind man Finally after three exactly the same wounds Caine just walked away but John died WTFbr Keanu Reeves with all due respect moving and fighting slower than a pregnant cowThere is no John Wick and there never was There is only one JohnJohn ConstantineJohn Wick is a combination of Zatoichi Musashi The Ghost of Tsushima and the RaidAt the end still can not bring down The High Table The rumor is true then The High Table is realTell you what the movie was amazing Keanu is just awesome again but this ad is the best ad Ive seen for a movie in my life honestly it really does do the movie justiceGreat movie but John being bulletproof and not even flinching from point blank range was just a bit too much suspension of disbelief I get his suit is kevlar or something but cmon If you can get past that and endure the extended fight scenes which are great on a big screen with a good sound system but can drag just a pinch youll enjoy it The first is still my favorite thoughhow about henry cavill as main villain in Chapter VThe matrixSatanic from toI knew I recognized the actor who portrayed Killa I just couldnt put my finger on it Of course it is Scott Adkins in a fat suit And Dolls from Wynonna Earp is Mr Nobody No connection to Nobody of Bob OdenkirkbrI love the movie especially the places for the fight scenes It was like a video gameThe last scene of JW made it seem as if John was gonna go against the entire High Table brbrBut JW turned out yo be a dusappointment Why does this movie even need to exist What exactly did John achieve here He got one Continental ruined saved one the blind assassin got his and his daughters freedom but nothing says he will not be called upon by the high table again in future the dog still has a bounty on her head brbrJOHN WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED EXACTLY THE SAME if he had just offed himself by jumping off the Empire State Building in the beginning of the moviebrbrHowever if the next JW is not a prequel and John comes back to actually finish off the High Table for good then JW will finally have a reason to exist Because this movie has singlehandedly presented the High Table as a threat that even John is unable to beat Looking back at the first movie now Vigoo and his quotimpossible taskquot seem like ants in comparisonbrbrAlso that dog is worth more in bounty than John I wanna see a movie with herI draw different styles of knives and swords If you are interested in new style knife drawings I am waiting for you on my channelJesus is coming

like an ordinary action film and as it progressed things started becoming interesting and last hour was amazing But in a film of about hours every scene was looking like going at supersonic speed

truly feel that the John Wick series is just a training simulation while hes in the Matrix It explains quite a bit of his story lineThey found bullet holes in John Wicks coffin but they could determine how many hole were from the outside shooting in or the inside shooting outThis is because quotyou kill my dogquotthis is the worst John Wick movie i struggled to make it halfway through before cutting it off this is the most retarded movie ive ever seen they just have no respect for the audience at this point were supposed to believe a blind guy can take on dozens of enemies with no problem suits can stop AR rounds but not a knife quoti am klausquot the knife through the hand scene that made no sense the ever changing rules and constant ways john can make amends despite constantly breaking the rules the movies were slightly absurd to begin with but watchable now its just so stupidWhere do I even begin this movie is an absolute masterpiece Chapter took this series to levels I did not even think were possible the last entries in the series were absolutely amazing and were near perfection but chapter is the best by a mileIts insulting this film I mean what the hell

literally didnt take my eyes off the screen i was locked in AI remember the good old days when to watch the end of the story you would have had to go through one maybe two sequels Today the series goes on and on up to four or more that at some point you forget when and why the story started With John Wick Ive got bored after the second part seems that the hero had endless resources of physical and mental resources not to mention luck guns and ammo and the armies of top assassins sent to eliminate him will always fail individual and collective What could possible challenge him John Wick against Predator Against Tanos I had to go through another two sequels for what John Wick dies and goes next to his wife He could have spared himself and us of all the trouble by putting a bullet in his head ad least he would not have died tired And Winston After all this fuss took his hotel back and the life of assassins host right from where he left it So if he will have another brush with High Table can start all over again I am sorry but the world that we live in today is beyond my comprehension Ad least the movie worldJOHN WEAK END OF STORYAM WAITINGmove was ok not so greatthe only bad

worse and worse so unrealistically cheesy over the top its hard to watch without cringing Im literally bored just waiting for them to end so i can see the story progression and were the best gets worse and is just a let down brbrSPOILERS Mr wick could have just died in the beginning of the movie and he would have saved so many lives he still dies in the end after all that after taking all his

mindblowing The whole franchise is for sureShame that he died was hoping for aThe amount of what can only be fake comments praising this crap is unbelievable Dude the quotplausible realismquot from the first movie is completely gone in favor of superpowers and plot armor Freaking Marvel movies are more realistic than this movie Armored suits have gone from not letting bullets through to giving off sparks and going metalic on bullet impact with drawbacks to the wearer It dosnt even move when shot yet somehow when the plot needs it to your can stab a knife through it perfectly fine or even just a weak slice Also if you take your eye off the main character in a scene for just a second you will see the person they currently arnt fight just flailing around waiting for his turn to jump inStart with bad night and end with great sunrisejohn wick is a Dum Moviea hrefaboutinvalidzCSafeza Keanu Reeves Great But JW story is Dum DumConstantinePLEASE make a John Wick third person videogame it will be epicIm sorry after watching this th movie john fight scene kinda slow like old man slowits super movie and I love iti swear no one can aim against john wick loli recognized the voice of old the dude quotthe Harbingerquot hes silas from transformers primeEl comentario espaol que buscabas Esta Pelcula como todas la saga es sper excelente en todo sentido y queremos ver John WickA blind assassin what a retarded storyline Terrible movieWas a little blown away when they basically copied the warriors movie Almost quit watching the damn movie Horrible idea with that bs DJ crapThis movie is fully packed with action such a thrillerI seen this times in the theater and loved it and bought it on apple tv good movie and very good scenesShoutOut to the Viggos sonbrHe gave us THE JOHN WICKWatching moviebrAnd I keep wondering when does john wick stop to eat and reenergize to fightBefore John wick there was Thing Thing If you dont know what Im talking about look up thing thing animationI love Keane the films good but to much like warriors etc shame its the last one But good filmI just will pay to pull that fucking nose ring of the radio woman and hear her scream and blood all overwould be good if all the fight scenes did not have everyone clad in bulletproof but not knife resistant suits and everyone imitating The Count From Sesame Street LoLPeliculnAND NOW ALL I WANT IS THE IMPOSSIBLE TASKis it just me that thinks this movie was dog shit the first two films are amazing the third wasnt as great but good this one felt like a parody of the seriesquot This viper mm pistol can carry bulletsquotbrbrProcedes to fire rounds without reloading while driftingAlong with Drive John Wick will be the closest thing well get to a Hotline Miami filmSaw the movie last night My wife said it was the most intense movie shes seen in a while And according to her from beginning to endGud oneA little disappointing to be honest The movie lacked the kind of dialogue that was in Wick and the direction to end the high table it alluded to in Wick I was expecting Laurence Fishburne to play a bigger role The villains role was not excitable There were too many locations to consider Nevertheless Keanu Reeves and the guest actors killed their roles Bravo to all the actors RIP Lance ReddickOmg super super movieLet me hope its not matrix againI didnt even know Donnie Yen could speak EnglishLoved it Classic Movie no doubt john wick is the best action movie franchisei loved the first john wick movie but this one was mid the action was just boring to me BUT the blind man made the movie interesting to watch honestly all the john wick action scenes i just skipped cause it was boring to meso many fan boys love the series but this one was bad fight scenes were absurd with vaudeville pulled punches and obvious delayed attacks time to retire wick before he becomes an indiana jones wussI just watched this movie Someone please explain to me why these are so popular This is the cheesiest corniest thing ive maybe ever seen with absolutely no story at all Hes literally fighting a blind man Terrible movietime and callhghJust watched this abomination This is bullshit at cosmic level Trilogy was just fine but you had to ruin this isnt itToo many impossible scenes in the movie brBest part was KaneIf theres anything I hate its when the movie is unrealistic hours of action thats so pathetic and childish that its not worth watching I thought that such movies remained in the late s but John Wick managed to surpass even them with its shallownessLong ass Fuckin movie with absolutely no story Movie doesnt make any sense I am yet to see a cop car with all the killing in the streets and why cant a single bullet kill anyone I noticed that its multiple bullets to kill and some people just seem to be traveling quicker than others Make it make sense I need my time I wasted watching this trash back and please let it be the last no more of that fantasyHave never seen a lying movie like john whickI wish someone counted how many men he dropped I doubt that even a German gunner in WW Normandy could kill as much Micky Mouse movieIS THAT DAREDEVILJohn Wick Sisu Jack Reacher The best movie ever wowI managed min so dumbThis time more new characters I love mrnobody and koji Nice movie to watchJohn Wick Rise from the dead This time it is allowed to aim for his headJohn Wick is coming back for a fifth film Hes coming backMost scenes looked a bit fake having trouble to get used to the AI or CGI images br Action story Time flies by hrs felt like nothing Way better than Chapter imo EnjoyBest movie and best franchise ever I love John wick soo muchLooks the theyre gonna make another john wick John Wick quotthe beginningquot Tells how he becomes John wickkeanu revesSome People dont understand how much respect this movie deserves Ive already watched it timesthis is the kind of movie you read the credits out of respectMan with long hair hits other men with shorter hair what a filmI liked the movie but it was too damn long The action was good but its like does every single fight scene have to be minutes longby the end I was just like thank god its over And why TF would you put Scott adkins in a fat suite come on that just looked weirdTo be honest I dont think there is any other movie that will be able to offer the quality of action that the John Wick series offers I waited nearly four years insanely to see the end and it was really great In any case the movie is a visual pleasure My rating isThe song chosen for this preview is quite possibly the worst thing my ears have ever heard and made actually made me cringe Im not making that up either Not even computers can make this generation sound goodI would love a John wick gameLooks a little boringIt was like watching kill BillJhon will dead in the final guysThey should have stopped after the first oneAwesome Love KeanuKeanu Reeves has always been brilliant and mysterious in his films which gives additional doses of suspense and integration to his work A tribute to this brilliant and accomplished actorJohn Wick has no bones I guess He keeps falling from high buildings and hitting Cars one after another and keeps walkingI wonder why John Wick isnt in Marvel series yet I mean with such an amazing super powersHe fights like that guy in Doom eternalbrLove John Wick foreverEither Im getting old or this movie just seems so stupid and like mehwhats a load of crapAbsloute overrated You guys really forgot why john wick was masterpiecebest John Wick movie ever made good to see franchise actually getting better unlike Fast n Furious LOLI watched its i enjoy it no matter what other say i came here did he really died dont want to spoiler But i feel film change the way its should be after i dont remember name of his but great actor died sad and those party people must be Way high But i felt like fighting some time real shit like getting slow and tired Not like super hero stuff Thats bulletproof suits now Shok Prof to can jump from building to and similar suit most of theme wereSo bad I had to log into YouTube to advise What a horrible movie It started out good with a nice story line and compelling acting from everyone but Keanu sorry Then it just devolved into a rediculous half hour of combatI like the first and movies but this is so unrealisticsuch a cliche so done before especially the cheesy thievery of the Warriors toward the end utter tripe imoCould be the dumbest most mindless piece of action shit Ive ever seen too much CG Actors old and slow in combat This is just as bad as the aging and what has turned disgusting Fast and Furious calamityWhat if John Wick is Neo and the quotJohn Wickquot series is just a complex simulation that Morpheus and Neo are trapped in all this timeAnother brave dog in this movie brJohn really have so much love for dogsso no police or law they can live in effel tour as they own it they can make gun fight beside it they can kill more than ppl in front of other ppl in elzi palace so france is just a cowboy place with no gouvernement no army no police stupide film with no logic for stupide pplune belle daube broubliableDonie Yen did an excellent job here also the Mexican guy from Boyka movie did great job would like to see him in more moviesI dont lik final story blind man fightng with people it should be little realty we are exceptng very bore that one partThis flick is something elseI love all John wick movies but the lack of realism these movies has is a force towards the end when he got kicked down the stairs when he started rolling that looked so fakeTrailer is perfectsuper noceOnly John Wick can stop bullets with WakizashiPeliencuevanapongalatienemalsonidogranpeliculasusanadeArguentinaI watched john wick I loved it after that I tried to watch while watching after few minutes Ive lost complete interest bcoz in we already know hes dangerous assassin so from its routine again hell get another mission and do some fights blah blah blahsame in etcCant wait to watch this oneWhat an incredibly terrible movie A blind hitman Can it get any more ridiculous I didnt think Reeves acting could get any worse but somehow he managed to do the impossible Anyone that thinks this is a good movie is definitely mentally challengedIts what I have expected to be and more Cant wait for chapter They cant kill him yetWatched the film last night and never once did I recognise Scott AdkinsBoring Long and boring dialogues Super expensive sets and locations are not cool anymore The fight at the hotel is goes on and on Some of the seems are just ridiculous he walks in to the church and gives his weapons at the door or at the very beguiling of the film he kills this Arab sheikh in the middle of the desert in the midst dole of no where make it believe for God sake its not a scifi film There is no simplicity They tried to hard to make the film look coolThe movie is awesome except the armour suit makes it very funny very unnatural They dont have any bullet mark on suit even if they get shot better wear a normal armour vest next timeThe reference from the warriors was awesome thanks John wick LOVE IT instead of Coney island its a churchI just watched john wick and the movie amazing and great and the ending was emotional and I cried this was very greatMy name is klausGETTING WORSE IN EVERY SEQUELKEANU NO MORE JOHN Q PLEASEJohn WickThis movie sucks I was hoping for a slower more considered finalebrbrNope got a Michael Bay esq action fest The bullet proof suit is one thing but its still gonna hurt like hell in this movie theu use their forearm to deflect hundreds of rounds its ridiculousbrbrThe choreography is way off as well once you get bored during a Bay fight scene you see his opponents on many occasions just standing waving their arms getting ready for their turn to be dispatchedbrbrTerrible movieRip Lance Reddickif I had a nickel for every time I watch a movie where Donnie Yen is blind I have two nickels which isnt a lot but its weird that happened twice rightmontage trop lent dommageThe legend still livesJohn Wick gun have infinit ammoOne of the GREATEST action movies in decades Theres on e scene late in the movie that has to be one of the greatest action scenes of ALL TIME Must see for any personOh my day rubbish brHis old slow and filming minutes a knucklehead fight doesnt work greedy destroy a nice movie sometimes you have to know where to Stop Is just disgusting to see half of the movie is just a prolonged fight with very slow motion movesI do enjoy a good john wick film I give them credit for their imagination How many ways can you shoot u a few dozen men that you havent shot up before They managed The overhead stuff was great Of course you have to accept the fact that a suit can be not only bullet proof but impact absorbing as well In all the cop shows one bullet to a vest knocks a guy out but here just pull the lapel over your face and whalla dont even pop a blood vessel Still good entertainment The previews had more swearing and vulgarities than this movie had Its a shame Rambo didnt have the decency to end his films like this one The last rambo The one after that last one Where he gets up on a horse yeah right so now we gotta suffer another last oneOut of the films this was definitely the best oneFantastic movie I watched itJohn WIck sat at a table and challenged Pennywise to a duel to the death let that sink inits sad john passed away and there wont be any sequel but may be a prequelThis was a very well produced pile of GARBAGE The fightshooting scenes are beyond ridiculous I watched like minutes then I quit Pure nonsense made for childrenyour family doesI mean now its just seemed a little too much that hes dropping everyone off like a fly and not taking damage from car hits at least It makes sense up to the point that he knows how to shoot better than everyone but not taking any damage throughout is exaggeratedI am Big fan of Donnie YenJohn Winston brWinston Jonathan brcan you take me to home brRIP a loving husband brWinston farewell my sonBest MovieRipWhy does every bullet goes straight passed him everyone is shooting at him but no bullet is hitting him totally bs broLike watching a shooting gallery gameThe movie does do justice to this trailerOverrated OverhypedbrGood visuals but everything else is pretty bad Especially the fighting is horrible The way their thin suits make them invincible and how everyone uses their jackets to cover their head haha Who thought that was a good idea to implementbrOr how John Wick goes on the floor and takes over seconds to put his feet around an enemy to make them fall while the other guy just waits for him to do it Laughable If you actually pay attention to the fights they are horrible It is quite entertaining mainly due to the good visuals But its laughably bad in every other regardPart was better This was disappointingI turned this shitty movie off you litteraly see them waiting in fighting scenes to attack the blind man reloads a empty mag no story build up glass hall with minimum destruction and the glass that has been destoryed the glass shards has been cleaned up i can go on for a while like thisBill Skarsgard they should have chosen a french actor to play a french guy the accent when he tries to talk french is horribleSeasons in the sun song sums up it up perfectly Awesome what should be the ending of the series Spin offs of the new characters would be cool thoughThis song in the trailer I was hoping it wouldve been included in the movie Especially after the ending This movie cant be topped either way The best since the st movie imo if not the best RIP Lance ReddickTotal rubbishThe end would have been better if JW were to enter that radio tower and shoot that bitch announcing the price tagJust like playing video game when setting the difficulty level to the easy and at the same time using all the cheats availablehours of endless shooting and little acting Who makes this shitSeriously are there no russian actors any more Its so lame to see wick in russia speaking with native russians who cannot talk shit come on politics and everything at least do voiceovermost comments be like I saw John WickChapther last night andI meanKeanu and Laurence toghether in a movieYOU JUST CANT MISS that simply THE BESTMother Goose Paint It Blackbra hrefhttpsyoutubeNvytSFGUSrshttpsyoutubeNvytSFGUSrsaIs that pennywiseI WANT TO SEE THIS SO BADTill the end of the movie i expected this background song of Westlife to b play but didnt found outI had to laugh at how many times John got hit by a car and fell out of a window then got up and walked away brThe man is invincible lolThe Best is the Radio Shout out to kill John wick WARRIORSDisappointing movie The first one was great and believable The others were so so This one was just boring Way too long and way too many fight scenes I gave up halfway throughAfter seeing the movie hes a good actor john wick sad its over but his fights stance in this not as good as previous JWomg wtf is thisare people so dumb these daysthat this is a good moviewe need one big cometThey Should Make A John Wick Video Game Fr Its Only Right Rip The Boogeyman John WickBest

trailerquotI dont sit at the tablequot brquotYour family doesquot What the fuck does that mean Wicks face is asking the same questionWell since John Wick has already been comfirmed i guess this entire movie plot was a waste of time its like the quotone last jobquot quote in the fast and furious films and theres now of themGreat movieGreat movieYou know whats funny a guy who was obviously lying said he had a copy of this movie and seen it over a year and a half ago it wasnt even finishedI have just seen John Wick Chapter and I really loved it I think this is the best in the franchise And as much as I would love to see future installments in the franchise I have to admit this is a great end to the story Especially cause the fight scenes are starting to feel a little bit repetitive I wasnt bothered but I want the series to finish on a high notebrbrHOWEVER I have an idea for chapter brbrThe movie starts with Shimazu Akira the daughter of his friend Shes in big trouble and many people are after her She john wicks her way through the first half of the movie but she needs help And she believes that john wick faked his death She spends a portion of the movie looking for him She finds him and manages to convince him to help him The end is an epic half hour jhn wick vs the table and ends with john killing the table members with help of course but he dies protecting shimazu It will be nice having john fight for something other than vengeance and freedomChills Ive watched this how many times and it always gives me chillsMy favorite movie John wickKGF CHAPTER loverthats too much shooting at him from feet and missed himTaking my old man to see this tomorrow hes and most likely not to enjoy it but nice for him to humour me on my birthday brIve got my pencil readyId love to see a series how John wick became the Baba YagaNo offense to Keanu Reeves but John Wick is a series for retards Like quotquotquotwooow violence blood A guy who manages to kill stormtrooperlike minions coming at him with no brains and no conscience who dont come to him at once but by like sheeps what a fun This is really entertainingquotquotquot I was forced to pay to watch it terrible an offense to

of the songMikael Nyqvist played the bad guy in John Wick Peter Stormare played the bad guy in John Wick Bill Skarsgrd plays the bad guy in John Wick Why so many swedes play the bad guys in Wick moviesThis happened years before the advent of the self aware replicating machines and years before the Architect were bornand years before Zion was contructed alongside with creation of The Matrix

Published On Dec Broa hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqEVUtrkBamptmsathe trailer talks itselfCan somebody please tell me how the card game called they play in this movieis it available on googlemr cool manGreat movie Really dumb But great movie I would recommend itThis and the Dark Knight trailer may be the two best examples of how an unbelievably good trailer gets you pumped up and then the movie blows you away while goes miles over all expectationsmaybe im wrongHonestly speaking i found the trailer to be more exciting than the movie i mean the movie has an extremely aesthetically pleasing background score but apart from the ending i found it boring at most parts But surely some scenes were incredibleive watched this times in theatersi already watch is extremly coolwao this is drom is

degradingHollywood is HollywoodObrigado John Wick por manter viva a vontade de assistir um bom filme SensacionalIt was really a good series but chapter was literally half filled with the sound of guns boom boom the sound keep hitting my mind throughout the night after watching itI like Keanu but please tell me Im not the only one who thinks hes one of the worst actors weve ever seen on screenre watched the og a few days before checking out still loved it even noticed a few new detailsbrwatched on a shit theatre the action scenes were too dark for mebrbut then i was on a jw high so i rewatched and on the day afterbrloved maybe even more than the og noticed amazing details the world building worked so greatbr has amazing action and the whole story finally made sense brso cant wait to re watch at homeso far this is the best movieLegend never dieIs Keanu Reeves really My ggodness he is like Dick Clark American Band Stand he does not ageThis is going to be phenomenalNahh John Wick died at the endThe suits in this movie would make iron mans look like a bishh LolDonnie Yen is fantastic in thisGreat action moviewhy do i feel like i watched this years ago This isnt that new is itIts been out for a while now but I finally got to see this yesterday Dont get me wrong I loved it its one of the most spectacular action movies Ive ever seen and I didnt feel awkward with the high body count as everyone is a hitmanwoman or working with them and John fights in self defence brbrHowever its sooo far fetched and ridiculous how much he survives and can carry on fighting and some of the main characters Noone in this is a cyborg alien or superhero or supervillain He gets knocked off the bonnet of more than one car and is fine gets kicked down several feet onto a concrete floor and is okay falls through a glass window on the third floor of a townhouse onto a car roof and gets up ok An assassins dog gets hit by a car and bumps off the bonnet and gets up and runs off brbrA big fight develops in a Berlin night club dance floor and its ages before anyone acknowledges it and they evacuate John goes into a Russian Orthodox Church and gets blasted with a shotgun by obviously a fake priest and John is fine When things kicks off in Berlin and Paris including amongst the traffic you dont see any police at all Theres a guy whose a hitman whose lost his sight but manages to fight perfectly and shoot a gun in exactly the right direction just going on hearing Its crazy but if you liked the other films or stuff like this you have to see itNiccJohn Wick is back for more killlingWhen is the clear copy coming out not cinema copyI give a on his nun chuck fight screen because I definitely pretty sure that hes not a simple for sureCringiest movie everI can never take seriously any fight scene in any John Wick films I just find them funnyCouldnt have asked for a better release date than my th birthday Keanu I love uu and this is the best movie of the year so farLove from BangladeshThe story and action scenes were perfectly awesome brLoved the movie and would watch it againJohn Wick number brCould not DieI stopped watching IDK at what point somewhere around the middle because the fight scenes are just dumb they dont look even remotely realisticI knew going in I would likely get turned off because I was already turned off from previous moviesThey really need to do a better job of creating an intense realistic story and scenes it COULD be a great series but instead it is something I dont care to ever see againbrThis is actually something that hollywood movies are doing a lot of late making their movies look silly stupid like they are catered to the cartoon crowd the little kid that wakes up Sunday morning to watch cartoonsbrThere is only ONE place for silly and that is a comedy anything else should remain serious and not look way out of place stupidWanna to say this chapter perhaps the best of franchise Love itFilmin son serisi miLove

choreography were phenomenal but what was also notable was Reeves choppy dialogue lol people in the cinema were laughing every time he talked Yeah I get that hes a broken man but that doesnt change how choppy and generic his lines sound like its satire Some of the other comments here would make you believe its an Oscar worthy film its simply an amazing piece of choreography and some unreal stunts that give fairly unmatchable entertainment valuea hrefhttpsyoutubeqFZxNcLeghttpsyoutubeqFZxNcLegaamazingprobably the best trailer A man has to look his best when its time to get merried or burriedAfter the part two it was clear NOT TO MESS with the guy just leave him in peace But no its part now Idiots dead idiotsNo way he died like that on the stairs and noone saved him they should make jw when mr nobody saves him somehowWhat cinema is supposed to beWhat A Fucking MasterpieceHow can he stop hide from bullets with a bare forearmIs this the final stageExcellent movie for me Best action movieMan this is such a spoilerytrailer Im so glad I didnt see this before watching the movie practically spells out the entire storyHe needs to get himself a lil girlfriend woman Hes lonley manSorry I didnt like itIn my opinion this movie was a disaster with unrealistic storyJohn Wick diescoolJohn Wick taught me that there is not a shame to lose a fight its a shame to be afraid of facing it Even John Wick took damage so why should I feel ashamed of taking damage tooThe major take Love is the greatest force in the universebrIt was neither about the car nor the dog but about who gave it to himI think this movie is an insult to anyones intelligence and commun sense brThis movie should not be categorized as action but science fiction the guy has unlimited bullets he never gets hurt even when he got hit by like cars this and fast and furious are such bullshit movies brI miss Rambo or predator where the guy actually get injured and fights back but this Com people give this guy a cape and a role in marvelI will buy this because of Keanudamnit Kurt CaldwellIts all started with a dogThe trailer is gorgeous and Keanu is beautiful as alwaysSad part he diedMany enemies attack John but they like to attack him one at a time because theyre respectful and wait for their turn to get killed by himThis movie is dumbId say the John wick chapters can never be as powerful as the first movie he lost his wife and dog days or maybe even only hours after her funeral what a way to trigger a retired hit man brAnyone killed my dog or cat Id hunt them down and they would payI love the

collector packIs it kid friendlyvery niceSTAIRSJust watched it amazing movieI am biggest fan of jhon wickJust watched it today The action the cinematography and the cast are just superb The sudden deaths and CONSEQUENCES of John Wicks actions are truly shown in this masterfully directed film by Chad Stahelski Just a MASTERPIECE Truly up there with Mad Max Fury RoadI like this movieJohn Wick movies make other action movies seem so blandKeanus actions speak mutch louder than his wordsThank god because jhon wick deadIts pretty cool how you made him look EXACTLY like the Fortnite characer That is some skilli cried coz it freaking amazing kudos to Keanu and all the castHollywood produces such horrible content these days Im terrified to commit to this long of a movie But Im going to go watch it Ill come back here later tonight and report on the movieDragons Breath scene was amazingThe most boring movie ever Put a group of to sleep Half of the cinema went home half way through the movie Big fan of the first chapters Part is just non stop kicking and punching in slow motion Dodging Bullets like balloons No dialogues at allThis is the best action movie in decades and the best in the series with a likable lead actor a great villain a supporting cast that all brought their A game a good popcorn plot AMAZING music awesome special effects and stunts stuntmen deserve an Oscar It didnt even feel like hours it flew by super fast Rina Sawayama real stood out hope to see that stunning beauty in more moviesdoes anyone know the song for this trailerThe best part of Keanu that I admire most is no matter what hes asked about in an interview is that he tries to answer the question hes asked Sincerely and with honesty His job is being an actor which is artistic in its nature Celebrity brings pressure along with the glitz that folks seem to see the most of because we all like fairy tales Keanu has used his name and good fortune to better the world no matter what His life has not been easy or was handed to him by any means Like the song written by Israel Houghton quotOnequot hes a good soul and is using his abilities on earth the best way anyone could We all want to be happy but life doesnt owe us anything Thank you Keanu for putting us in a better place and for making it known we can learn to fly again after our wings were broken Everyone loves a quotwinnerquot but they dont walk in your shoes everyday Your heart beats like ours does but you walk your talk You n I are not related but youre my quotbrotherquot People need to learn practice and then DO What a great teacher you areDamn this movie was so fucking good Im mind blown the shots were crazyyyy best movie out of the three frbrRip John wickI really want to see Tony jaa in John wick soonS tier movie and

dead yet this is all Johns plan to escape from the high table because what is the trust of the table call John back for a mission so John has faked death the man did not die after falling down from such a tall building he will die like this and john told to go home we will know all this in john wick chapterThis movie was near perfect The one part that i didnt like is when The messenger kid told his daughter they are coming then the daughter asked Jhon Wick if hes armed and he shoots the messenger kid in the head for no reason What the fuck filmmakers The messenger was not on the opposite side and Jhon Wick aint ignorant that small mishap scene fucked up the entire movie That scene should have not occured What he was testing his bullets on the kids head makes no senseSometimes its just better to quit while youre ahead First Wick was goodthe rest after wasI was disappointed I think theyve run out of ways to killI was so excited to see Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen in the movieEven though this trailer essentially gives away everything its still fucking sickCant wait to buy itBoringa hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqEVUtrkBamptmsaSaw it last night woow it was a masterpiece and good storylineGreatest actionSae it in theater already gonna go watch it again cause it really goodAm gonna go to the theater and watch it againAnd so it continues again The John Wick films are Greatly appreciated Thank youquotJohn Wick the Final Chapterquot anyone Winston and Bowery King were entirely too unmoved at the end though its true theyre not known for wearing their emotions on their sleeves And Bubba being there didnt mean anything In fact if Wick was really there in the ground perhaps the dog wouldve pawed the grave But what a way to fade away and find peace Wicks death is terribly convenient allowing him to go off somewhere with a new identity to live off the grid find his peace blahblah Of course thats only the plot of every third movie like this especially WesternsbrSide bar LOVED the set piece shot from above going roomtoroom The blaster gun igniting the baddies was sick But I was waiting for him to blast one guy and then we see the force of the shot send the flaming bad guy rolling into a large fireplace where hes basically a large burning log LOL I think it wouldve brought the house down in the packed theatre where I saw the film They were already howling and cheering other places brFavorite line of the movie quotHave fun out therequotbrHonorable mention quotFuck offquotI love the opening to this trailer the introduction to Lionsgate with the piano John Wick walking within the magnificent halls of an Orthodox Cathedral him lighting a candle to his wife within Gods Communion and him and Donnie Yen speaking as friends next to one another Great film and a great possible finale to Wicks storyWhere can i watchdownload it pleaseGreat film and a fantastic trailerWould be nice if they made movies on john wicks origins leading up to these moviesKane was just amazing in the movieI can watch this trailer all day still getting chills agreedThe first movie i paid and watched in cinema since the COVID pandemic fromCringy choreography and a bit of a let down Bring on EqualiserSo John what do you Need Now I Need Grenades Flamethrowers amp Rocket Launchers thats What i Need NowI just cant belive people talk about how good this movies is brMovie is joke Fuckin parodyThis movie is totally absurd and ridiculous although the comat scene etc are somehow entertaining the fights are way too much it could compete with those indian movies John wick at it again fighting army of elite killer brThe stair scene was simply ridiculousTwo mythical legend in one ClipMovie of the Decade John WickmyThis is not a moviebrThis is John wick movierest in peace quotBabayagaquotjohn wick dies in lastIts real action thx for movie i love it im just guy from far around youre placeDonnie Yen man and Keanu Reeves man this movie is set to be a game changerRemember when the st John Wick came out people were laughing all that for a puppy and a car Ah good old daysI watched itPerfect this is my best actor anogona muchinda uyu sando dzakeI cant wait Im so excited to watch it John Wick movie will be the bestI saw this movie times and the best action movie ever been made talked about the lightning the beautiful location and the best of all Keanu nun chuck fight screen and the fabulous Marquis outfit lol but the most of all Keanu trained very hard for this movieAnybody knows the church location at the first scene in this trailerRina Sawyawa she is a angelSo happy to say this movie was as good as this trailer waswhat is the song name plzBaba YagaMoral of the story dont abuse animals It might turn out into the biggest action packed thriller of all timeI watch bcuz of Bill SkarsgrdWatched the movie today and its a great final movie hour action masterpieceThis was an absolute masterclass Im action film making That long tracking shot blew my mindOscar Winning movieAbsolutely the best trailer everBy far the worst movie of theI feel like why Caine with his level of skill would ever want to listen to Marquis With just th effort of killing John Wick he could have sent Marquis to his graveI am blown by the ratings of chapterBill skarsgard is the only reason Im going to watch itbill skarsgard is sooo fineWatching this trailer after having seen the movie there is so many hints and foreshadowing that i dont know how i didnt see it comingTrailer is much better than the movie They should just play the trailer for hours and be done with itShould I take my girl or go aloneBill SkarsgardThank God I didnt watch the trailer before watching the movie The entire plot of the movie has been laid out in the trailer Yes John Wick is more about the execution than the story but Im glad I didnt know anything before watching the movieMy philosophy on life What would John Wick doI just REWATCHED AND REBINGED THE ENTIRE JOHN WICK SERIES INSTALLMENTS and I am very much excited to witness this legendary film sir KR the GOATDoes anyone know the source of the soundtrack from a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqEVUtrkBamptmsa to a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqEVUtrkBamptmsais awesome too Also i can see theshadow of Stephen Chow from the gamble scene Audience from Hong KongRegalShe can have my food at dinnerDoing these messages are the bestIt was delayed by covid well Another great lie from the governmentsAnd ScorpionThis movie and franchise is like an art and someone turn that into a movie So beautiful and well execute A movie about retired assassin being hunted WOWPerhaps the best conclusion to a movie franchise ever Everything is better than the previous films and the ending is perfectI watched this movie today man it was worth every penny every secondMy favorite series John wickYeah John Wick movie concept are fit for the schemers and evil gamers wherein they will be the actors being hunted by assassins and mercenariesJohn diesquotIm KlausquotOMG JW is spectacular Just saw it tonight Sat and I was transfixed by how incredible this is brGo See it peoples it is amazing br I love you KeanuIve just watched it left the room a different personHoping to get a spinoff movie for Tracker to expand into the Payday gang more hitman in sleek suits gtgtbrbrIf anyone of you are following the quotPaydayquot game lore which interestingly John Wick is a acquaintance to the Payday Gang Wick and a particular character Nicolas alias quotChainsquot were former comrades during their time in the military Which would explain why Mr Nobody would know of Johns antics and tactics in greater detail than any other regular tracker would to demand such a high compensation for his service And also the video showed how Mr Nobody similar to John wore his watch facing inwards suggesting military background So why would John possibly not recognize Mr Nobody Possibly because they were just former comrades and not exactly friends and according to the Payday lore Nicolas aka quotChainsquot due to his itchy trigger finger and generally unreliable personality caused him to get kicked out fairly fast Chains had then left the Navy and went into the world of mercenary troops offering his military expertise to the highest bidder ltlt which was basically what he was doing in the movie It is possible quotThe Trackerquot could have a spin off film to expand on this since in the Payday lore Wick eventually resurfaces after a time of quotgoing darkquot to lend Chains and his buddies a hand And this could be really exciting if they slowly bring in more hitman in suits ie the Payday gang comprising of quotDallasquot quotHoxtonquot quotWolfquot and quotChainsquot himself with a lot of depth in their backstory And to support this if you look back at John Wick or search quotJohn Wick Payday easter eggquot on google you will see an snippet off the film with clown masks behind the extra and the more prominent clown mask you see is ChainsThis is the best john wick movie ever made This one was deep and definitely IconicFinished watching JW and OH MY GOD Im just at a loss of words just FANTASTICWhat a great time great movie Donnie yen is that guy loved there friendship hood ending I wasnt madd full of action whoooWhat a perfect action movie hands down the greatest action movie ever madeThe movie is better than the trailer The cinematography is excellentI just watched all sequels now in hours now waiting for release for ott platforms the th oneMr John Wick only said words in the entire hour long movie even that purple suit gangster dealer said twice the words in minutes scenes This shows Mr Wick was only interested in talking with fists and bullets in this incredible action flickNice movieIs it the last part of the seriesTHEY KILL OFF JOHN WICK HE ACTUALLY DIESAfter this they should do another ConstantineJohn Wick ZEROHelen was pregnant Hidden in remote island funded by her father WINSTONthe puppy is the clueThis is gonna be da best movie of the yeargarbage full of hate same as liberalismHes still missing part of a finger from number Impressive commitment to continuityhowww the

better this was long and bit disappointing despite lot of fighting this had no surprises and twists at alljust watched it and the ending is the most beautiful ending in the history of beautiful

beautiful end of John Wick Thank you to everyone that was part of these amazing moviesJohn Wick is the best action movie ever madeIts hard to dieHonestly Donnie yen dont deserve to be in this with

movieNo wordsdid winston die someone give me spoiler pleaseBaba Yaga will be remembered as one of the badass character in the cinema historyThe thing that makes John Wick movies different from other mindless action movies is the story is so well written with on point character development It would be impossible to watch a guy killing people for almost hours if not for strong set up and purpose Every character is strongly anchored Well doneNormally even a few cool set pieces would make any movie watch worthy but this movie has plenty and each betters the previous one The shooting scene from the top angle deserves applause and the cinematography is just great Stellar performance from main cast members especially Keanu and Donnie Both of them were in their element Outstanding finaleI always have goosebumpsdefinitely the best movie in the john wick seriesJohn wick fans likeI want to say Keanu is great in these the set the design production sound and action is all great And the truth is you are going to watch a man who after this movie killed people in eight days brBecause his dog was killedbrJust to clarifyThe best action movie Ive ever seenTruly one of the films made of

u need to book them or u wait hour or so before u get another onebrThe movie doesnt continue from Chapter There is a lot missed out from the story line from John Wick through to but there is a long jump in the story from to He was shot out of the window Winston at the Continental New York and ends up on the ground after falling out a window picked up by Tick Tock taken to Bowery King tipped out of a trolly in front of Bowery wounded and ended at that point John Wick starts years in the future and u dont have any idea what happened to John Wick in the years at the start of Chapter The way

Night movie is amazingGoing to watch it for the third time in CinemaI cant wait for this but please enough with the slowed down dramatic song remixesJohn wick diesHow many people here after watching the movieAll movies were great Very tough to accomplish Especially to make each better than the last This by far was the best out of theDonnie yen killed itThe song in this trailer hits much differently when you seen JW and saw the end Also RIP Lance Reddick Do not miss this movie this has to be seen in the most Imax experience possibleWhat a movieWhat a movie Go see it everyoneIf the world hates you remember that it hated me first Jesus ChristDidnt find it intrestingSound Department did the most hereThey should have named it the bullet dodger if fits lolThis church scene got me f up i visit the grave every week to say hello and as john said not beacuse i belive they can hear me but because i wish i was wrongWhen I watched the movie I thought that Aurelio had fixed his mostang Boss and brought it to him but the director had another opinionI was so happy to see John wick use nunchucks in this movie my favorite partThe color grading for the film was copied from Harmony Korines Beach Bum Spring Breakers and Trey Edward Shults WavesIts now JW but I still keep on watching up to now JW when get boredThala will be proudThis movie was great I just streamed it in a crappy quality and I still really enjoyed it Definitely better than amp The bullet proof suits are getting crazy but thats whateverThe nut job raccoon revenge movieNew movie cinmas soonJust watched this

serii rozumiem e juz wiek no ale moe ju odpocz czas pozdrawiamBS movie Keep adding K people to be killed by Wick and none of them manages to take a head shot I mean first movie was ok but then one man kills like k people and no govt notices in any country where Wick is playing god mode I mean come on it becomes boring after sometime Every mins they add thirty people who get killed like vegetables on repeat This Movie has no substance neither did andwe want countinue john wick in chapter etcMRWiCk lots of love from INDIAJohn wick dies in the end Thank me laterOther movies guns are always ever

reading this if you havent watched the film go fucking watch it you wont regret you will if you not watch in theatreHopefully at the end of John Wick he will be quietly alive and far from what he used to doremember equilibrium when ppl mocked GunFu well whose laughing nowI watched John Wick last night and it was an incredible movie It was without a doubt the best action movie I have ever seen The representation of John Wick and his friendship with Donnie Yen was amazing Both characters had impressive combat skills making for a great movie In my opinion this is the best movie of all time and I dont think anyone has created or will create a series like John Wick It was a masterpiecebrJohn Wick sketcha hrefhttpsyoutubecomshortskveYpQyrpgsiEnSIkaIECMiOmarEhttpsyoutubecomshortskveYpQyrpgsiEnSIkaIECMiOmarEaGo piss off Keanu and braindead supporters of Hollywood garbage labeled as movie art the world doesnt need shameless exploitation of violence just to make rich people get their excess lifestyle without interruptionsEvery movie after the first one is pure crap The first movie was gritty and simple This is just cartoon moronic fanfareYou were a very great talent in the movie industry RIP Lance ReddickSaw it today and while I enjoyed the characters this film completely lost the plot The storyline is farcical unbelievable and nonsensical There is suspending reality and then there is insulting the audience This was a bad filmIm sorry but HELLLLLLL YEAHJust watched this movie last night i say out of an absolute masterpieceSo far I have noticed that it ripped off Zatoichi and The WarriorsThey made chapter cartoonish by adding chinese and japanese characters The movie lost touch with realismJust watched this moviebrbrWhat a moviebrJust amazingIp Man versus John wick this will be the best movieDude that sucks that he diedIm looking very forward to watch this latest chapter of John

every moment Caine was on screenWarriors ripoffI saw it today and it was phenomenal Defintely the BEST of the four Simply magnificentJust amazing Keanu is the manJohn Wick absolutely greatThis movie glorifies violence too much and within it someone says quotKill them allquot or something like that why are you people creating movies like these still create something more educational and nonvoilentbrbrBut the quotMoviequot was cool create another one but with a weapon that doesnt require reloading even if it is impossible just for the fck of itbrbrAlso these people were using Technology against him something else to take into considerationRIP ReddickRest In Peace Lance ReddickJust watched it this morning Id give it a perfect The action dialoguefight scenes and plot was on pointJust came back from the cinema No matter how high your expectations are the movie will exceed itJust watch it yesterdayOne of the best action movie for this year so farJust finished all chapter today what a dayI know someone has probably already said this but brAll because of a DogI heard that the Black man who is responsible for the safe haven Hotel in the movie has died in real life RIP to a legendNot going to take my children to see this and cry about gun violence in America Hypocrisy to the nth degree Wake up America if you truly love this countryi never know this movie if my bf not bring me watching amazing movie fighting full movie show what is friendship promise love and never give up until the end love this movieNot bad id say but ive told this might be the end of the series and its a disappointment compared to parabellum The shooting are the same They copied the dog action from He only used grapple and his gun skills were weaker than first Specially others had bit more screen time than expected Wish it was more john wick than the othersGreatest Action Movie of all timeWasted hours of my life I like action but not violence Guess I was cluelessSaw this last night Its always been impressive how each sequel in this series tops the previous entry As far as action movies go JW is one of the best Ive ever seenSaw a screening in IMAX it was awesomeTodo por un perritoI watched this video and immediately grew a beard and became a man of focus commitment and sheer willFor Indian viewers its a very slow movie just shooting guns thats all story line is not goodJohn Wick was everything I had wanted Matrix to beWake the fck up Samurai We have a Paris to burnThe best action movie of but I give it a for the poor selection of the cameo with Sven Marquardt quotKLAUS in the movie Its disgusting to see the face of a damn and horribly ugly pig on the big screen Besides its just He says the words of a retarded quotIm Klausquot quotIm Klausquot according to his medical diagnosis Thanks to the animal protection people for including that pig and containing itHalf good half bad But the PATHETIC ending ruins the whole point of chapters and the JW character itselfJohn wichk diedComing back to the trailer after watching the movie hits different New favorite movie of all timeOklahoma and thanks for your kind wordsBest part is when John wick dies in the end after the duelJust saw the movie WHAT WAS THAT best movie everDonnie Yen would easily beat keanu reeves Love to see donnie yen confronting keanu reeves ltThey could technically make a chapter where John Wick survives the shootout and a new person becomes head of the high table and John dies in a final battle and the scene at the end of the movie of them visiting Johns grave is several months or even a few years after the shootoutthe long lost form of narrative structure of Buster Keaton Harold Loyd and Charlie Chaplin silent movies parcialy brought back with Jackie Chan is now in its full glory When you go see a Musical one expects amazing singing and choragraph dancing the plot might be there but its normally second to those thecnical aspects Action Movies done in that way just dont exist Until THIS movie STUNT WORK on HIGH LEVEL Lets create an oscar for that please John Wick is ACTION EXCELENCE Thank You Lionsgate the bet payed off stars out ofseason in the sunJohn wickthe whole movie is an action masterpiece but the third act is something else entirely i cant believe those madmen topped themselves with this one a new peak in action cinemaBest movies everI didnt like the fact that they killed off quotLance Reddickquot in the first min of the move thats was lameOh man What Chad has done to this series is incredible And Keanu Donnie Adkins and Skarsgard in one frame Its a treat to eyes Already watched it twicea hrefhttpsyoutubekvmrUShnfQhttpsyoutubekvmrUShnfQaI like when he dies in the end after the duelThis franchise movies touching the high sky of movie industryGoodbye

masterpiece is an understatementPlease when is the coming out Im tired of waitingAn Action masterpeice I seen yesterday so Im here nowJohn Wick chapter make me cry for some timebr When the receptionist killed by that arrogant assholebr When John Wick said quotloving husbandquot to winston suddenly I can feel this is the last chapter on John Wicks journey and its really really hard for

the best action movies I have seen so farJust saw JW tonight and it was great especially the last hour of the movie The nobody character and his dog were also great The movie ended the way it should have for that character For me the original JW was the best because it had purpose and heart The first JW movie could have been a standalone movie because it was that goodKeanye Reaves is not an actor hes a paycheck He cant act Hes just himself assuming the identity they pay him toThis is what a trailer should be Tell you just enough about the plot showing you the epic scenes to come without revealing the best moment while getting you all hyped upLOVED IT LOVED IT FANTASTIC ABSOLUTELY GREAT JOB I love the filming of this one taking it to the next level The birdeye view of the fighting sequence was thrilling Oscars needs to add a category for stunt coordinationThis Is BreathtakingMovie was fkin awesomeSo glad I never watched any of the trailers for JW Just watched the movie and this trailer gives away they whole story I got to enjoy it without knowing what was coming next and enjoy the story as it unfolded Absolutely incredible filmGreat movie guys Highly recommend itWhat was the

Mr Krabs and Pennywise lol Thisll be greatJohn wick vs ip man cant miss thisDont believe the hype youll enjoy it more then I dont think it was as good as everyone is hyping it to be The action sequences had some obvious flaws and felt a bit repetitive almost like the director ran out of ideas on how to kill a man with a gun Some dudes did a backflip after getting shot in the head which seemed a bit obviously fake Theres also a scene where the guy getting hit by JW is so delayed in falling over that I looked around in the cinema to see if anyone else noticed it cause it felt so fake Other than some obviously bad choreographed scenes two of the newly introduced characters fell very flat Especially Bill Skarsgards villian Anyways still a great popcorn action movie I think I went in with way too high expectations and maybe thats why I didnt enjoy it that much JW has to be my favHe stole John Wicks car and kill his dogHoping for John Wick soonbrbrPerfect John Wick br out of

s the musicI JUST WANT TO KNOW WHEN WILL THE PREMIERE OF THE FOURTH PARTRIP Lance ReddickThis is one of the RARE film franchises that if given the opportunity I would watch in sequence in a theater having breakfast lunch and dinner while polishing off a Bottle of Blantons john wicks favorite bourbon whisky This franchise was such a well written and constructed storyline endearing us to one of the most violent sociopathic killers who found true love but lost it tragically and will do everything possible to just to remember that love Remembering it created the most incredible fight choreography ever put together in film Hats off to John woo GunFoo style adapted by fight scene coordinator Jonathan Eusebio Reeves training in both Japanese and Brazilian JiuJitsu translated well to the Krav Maga style used most dominantly in the fight scenes throughout the franchise With the recent death of Lance Reddick it is a bitter sweet final performance but likely one that will be forever etched in history as generations of movie goers will watch this franchise for many years into the future I plan to watch all three just before I head to the silver spot dine in theater in Atlanta to watch and they better have some Blantons Bourbon whiskey to sip while I watchRest in peace Mr Lance Riddick brCharon will be greatly missedAll of this could have been avoided if those Russians never

unto the LORD and he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon Isaiah brFor the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord Romans brThe LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit PsalmsYo ya visto ms de veces identific con ello mi pregunta cmo se puede soportar eso y ms claroJohn Wick amp are perfection and I watch all the time is ok Cant wait for KeanuwowowowowowThanks to Vigos Son we could watch these movies John wick kickin aPennywise vs NeoOh yeassssssss Donney YenAnxiously waiting for march and still dayyyyys left fkI love John wick chapterJohn Wick gtgtgtFuck N Furious brChapter is surely going to break many records in India brGood luck Mr Wick Baba YagaIn real life may we never offend a man like John Wick for it is better to not have been born than to have lived a short life ended by JohnEveryone coming out to see Ip Man vs John Wickcant waitWe had joy we had funbrWe had John Wick with a gunbrKilling bad guys by the score brBut there always seem to be more brbrWe had joy we had funbrNow weve dogs to get it donebrChewing bad guys privates offbrWhile we just sit back and watchDonnie Yen with Keanuthat says it all right there Gonna be a good show for sureI always wonder if Johns wife was killed by the High Table in the hopes of dragging him back into their fold It would be easy for an organization as powerful as they seem to be to bribe or force a doctor to misdiagnose a persons illness or perhaps even give her a fatal disease Its still never been stated what killed her only that she became ill and passed away from what may have been cancer brbrThat would be awesome because you know that John would slaughter the entire High Table if he discovered that they are the reason why his wife is deadIt looks great but its just a money grab The rd movie didnt make any sense I have no idea what this one is doingGrandmas marquee The most annoying and most childish song ever written as a theme song Horseback chases Who came up with such ridiculous production design for a wellestablished movie franchisebrbrI hope the actual movie is better than this promotional trailerLiving dream of arrival of this moviedays leftI cant believe they actually put in a sword blocking bullets AFTER Deadpool already made fun of how absurdly futile that would beI am happy to keep giving my money over to the John Wick franchiseHave the trilogy on repeatDammit Im so pumped for chapterDefies logic common sense and laws of physicsI am so in love with this seriesbrAnd I also dislike very strongly that they wont respect that mans wishes and just let him live his best life in peace with his puppy dog Please never end this movieHow many more John wick movies they are going to makeAnother awesome Wick movie I cant wait to see itSo Chapter will be the final chapter isnt there suppose to be totalSo much violence So disappointedOG TrailerIp man is in john wickThe producers of this movie have made a mistake to cast the chinese actor Donnie Y in this movie He does not represent Hong Kong people He was NOT born in Hong Kong and he is more like an ass kisser to the communist regime There many Hong Kong people will boycott and not watch this movie Donnie shows contempt for the people of Hong Kong and his presence will damage the image and reputation of the film industry unfortunatelyPlease boycott this movie Donnie Yen is a supporter of the Chinese Communist regime and has made several remarks in support of the Chinese governments policies including supporting the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong and accusing Hong Kong protesters of being rioters These remarks not only violate the spirit of freedom of speech but also deny the rights of the people of Hong Kong to fight for their freedom and democracyTwo of my fav actors together in one movie John Wick is the Matrix movie we needed but we got that crappy woke film Cant believe how powerless Neo was in that movieMy boyfriend a huge Keanu Reeves fan made me watch the first three movies in day so he can take me to the cinema to watch this on my birthday I fell in love with this movie and fell in love with my guy more See you on the rd John WickThis will get lost amongst the comments but I gotta ask has anyone thought to pitch an origin movie

best Reap it a hrefaboutinvalidzCSafezaJohn really potrays the protagonist rolebrBelieve me when i say this will be the best movie ever in brNot even Fast X shall surpass thisGun haters go crazy LOLIf you want to find save ground where not to get killed in this franchise just look for an uncool place No one gets ever killed in John Wick at uncool places The table probably has strict rulings never to be broken for never killing any man or woman at an uncool placeJohn wick and were pretty ass so well see how this goesIf you meet Keanu Reeves I advise you not ask him for an autograph with a pencil A pen is better because at least the ink doesnt rub offDude should have just let the dog liveenough is enough the original movie was great but with each new instalment it got less and less

aimed at Jonathan for a kill but little did we know its getting more complicatedquotFailure to meet at sun risequot Well saidJohn wick is such a great matrix sequalKeanu sick as an actor my reason for saying this be no matter what role he plays hes always that matrix character His energy always the same in every movie Just think about for a moment any other actor you see in movies completely transforms into the character theyre playing but not this guy No matter if hes a football player a father a contract killer he acts the same And Ive watched every single movie hes ever played inBest action franchise Original unique and not based in disney or warner bros BS This team should do johnny silverhand cyber punk movie nextThe glass box interior is repeated for the final boss fight againJust finished chapter and left me wanting more and here we are we got it boys lets goYes please All of thisI want there to be a John Wick where its just two hours of John at the beach or

Love You As Keanu Charles Reeves might want to meet up or maybe have a single conversation with such loyal loved fans like you areKeanu Charles Reeves would want you to write him personally as he would like to talk to you my name is Lilliam Westbury and I happen to be his personal managerYeah baby first day first showIm so confused on why in the rd movie he wants to kill Winston but now they are talking I thought they were taking the high table down the trailer make it seems they still following the rules So are they or are they not trying to take down the high table Completely thrown off did I miss a movie or somethingI hope Jackie Chan will be in John Wick ChapterPeople go on about how nice Keanu Reeves is but lets be honest here this is just pure gun violence death murder mayhem Try and look at it differently the guys a wooden actor being used to propagate murder endless murder is this really entertainment Not really Grow up this DOES influence idiots out thereI love all John Wick moviesIs this the end of John wickWhy am I just finding out about this Should I began with ChapterHurry upNow we got ip man pennywise and a crazy japanese ronin all trying to bring jw downI will be in the theater watching this movie on opening dayEvery John wick surprise me now with this famous cast and talent also skill will be a great conclusionIm beyond excited part ended on such a cliffhangerI loved the first one because I love dogs and I tell people who try to tell ME its quotjust a dogquot get thrown out of the house if they dare to diss any of us here As for this movie how is he even upright and not broken and bruised all over Fans today are so accepting of any sort of silliness that movies push forth like guys who get shot in the arm but still use it as if nothings happened RidiculousIt was bad enough through the end of part but theres no way in hell he survives that shot to the head and the fall and banging all the way down to the ground parts and were utterly absurd and I expect this one to be the same Even Batmans fights and survival isnt so obviously fake and impossible not even when its that joke Ben AffleckThis is gonna be a snooze festAnd I thought the first movie was enough But here we are a hrefaboutinvalidzCSafezaReally waiting to see Keanu vs DonnieI really enjoyed watching all parts but am i the only one who has in back of his mind that he is going to survive anyway cause he is John WickI amwaiting for this movieI cant waitHope they add Carrie Anne Moss for the fifth bring back the whole crewImagine if they can create a universe based in JohnWickVerseSo what wick is fighting the triads now Or the entire high tableI need a gun love that classicI could never ever get tired of these John Wick moviesAint gonna lie this gonna be some greatest creation myan Eager to watchHow can a year old guy kick so much assWow I wait this movie film in YouTube channel I like it Keanu reeves movie film actionsWow nice movie film actions nice

years of respect if not friendship betrayl left unpunished lola hrefhttpsyoutubecomwatchvkDpdDToOampfeatureshareshttpsyoutubecomwatchvkDpdDToOampfeaturesharesaThe one thing all these action movies is a trade because real life Navy seals soldiers or martial arts and gun club trainers train the actors to play their parts they are cast in the films Case of a real life incident we hope will not happen these people know how to defend themselvesJust three more months before John wick Im still curious how this will end for him will he be the man in history known to take down the high table or die a peaceful death like his friend said did you ever think how this would end for you the table will never stop calling for him and even he cannot kill it everyone in the world but he will die tryingthis is only going to be as good as the music is In the first movie it had kick ass music and it made the show especially the club scene with the song quotthinkquot This sequal has got to have some charged music it in it to go with the action scenes or its going to suckThanks peopleImagine JW coming out atIm not a gointhecinemaandwatchmovie kinda person Last time I went to a movie hall was about years

the movie the part where Winston says that Johns family sits at the high table and the lyrics I was the black sheep of the family literally reflect on how John is the one different in his family probably the one who never sat at the hight table and managed to have a true happy relationship with someone Simply perfectTHANK GOODNESS brFinally the th episodeI am going to need a gunIm going to

the table I wouldnt be surprised that Winston is using John to either eliminate those who are trying usurp his power BECAUSE HE IS THE HEAD OF THE TABLE or using John to gain power to overthrow the

awesome movieI like how they have used real guys who knows their stuff even if not as known as Donnie Yen In chapter three the pretty much best one to one fight was with the guy from Raid as in that the baddie in the kitchen fight scene which is RiDiculous scene Then again stuntmen who can direct knows what to do I know Reeves has contacts to atleast some of the martial artists toobrbrLike say Jackie Chans Hong Kong movies many times he or Sammo Hung were directing and knew not to play with the camera too much so you see the action Then Jackie came into US didnt get to do some stunts which he wanted and ok for that liability and insurance things but the style of cut cut cut is stupid The stunt looks way less impressive that way than a good camera placement After Jason Bourne goddamn the shaky camera and cutting waay too much came its own fad that ended into Taken that isnt even watchable anymore Ofcourse Liam Neeson isnt Reeves condition but it was ridiculous and you build the script around what he can do convincingly and what can be masked with stuntmenI dont think Ill ever get tired of this franchise no matter how many sequels it getsIm sure not every one will agree with me but ever since i saw Donnie Yens character get shafted in Blade I have wanted to see him fight in American cinema In a fight that really high lighted what he is capable of and I think this is going to be

movies are great because of those Actors with supporting cast members around them Any movie these Actors are in I Love quotThe Day The Earth Stood Stillquot Keanu Reeves smoked that movie too Fishburne should have been in that Movie Keanu Reeves Good Stuff Guys Keep RockingI was waiting a lot for this movieKeanu Reeves amp Donnie Yen need a gun now what a wonderful world there is no disappomnetBuggyman has arrivedThis entire series is pretty terrible It all revolves around the coincidence of some gangsters kid spotting Johns car at a gas station amp proceeding to use extreme violence to take it At that point why didnt he just kill John Then just because his wife sent him the dog amp they murder it after a whole day of ownership he goes on a ballerina killing spree to murder everyone in sight just to destroy his beloved car minutes after getting it back Its just painful amp idk why people like it so much I like Reeves but come on Anyway thats my hot take get all butthurt about itKeanu Reeves N Donnie Yen what a blast going to be the best John wickIf this movie is great which every film since has proven this will achieve what the Matrix didnt A successful TetralogyAll this sparked off by someone stealing his car and killing his dog hes got issues lmao Have you got issues John quotYeahhhhhhquotCant wait to see the BoogeymanDonnie Yen Keanu Reeves and

their just something about him like Congratulations Mr Reeves on another successful movie Definitely not going to miss itIm exhausted with these movies They should have made Chapter the last one and had this be a trilogy The story is not deep enough to warrant movies brbrA guy kills people who killed his wifes dog that she gave him as a gift before she died then avoids getting killed and kills people who wanna kill him for killing the people who killed his wifes dog Thats it Thats the basic plot of the John Wick franchise Also can they let Lance Reddick get away from that desk and be cool for once They gave him a little moment in Chapter they need to ride that momentum and give his character a better role in the movies I probably wont be seeing ChapterThis time I will watch this movie because of Donnie Yen Sorry Mr WickWheres his pitbullNo Scott AdkinsNow I need Keanu Reeves and Denzel WashingtonquotFailure to meet at sunrise will result in executionquotbrbrMarquis sends killers to

talkingyessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssscant fg wait for thisThe flow and utility of AMZVR integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and throughSo impressed with the journey AMZVR has made in just a few days and who knows how far it will goBuyyy signal for AMZVR this is a main trend for a reasonAll the fangirls for AMZVR shine bright Love you allBe honest if the assets or stocks you bought turned out the way you expected I can say that it didnt do that for me until I discovered Amazons powerplay with AMZVRBest day of my life Amazons annnouncement with AMZVR did so much we cant be wrong now can weThis was unexpected that Amazons move would enable a new asset called the AMZVR but I am in a way impressed with itHad a bunch of talks already on AMZVR but there is just so much time for talking and little bit less for acting time to act nowNow that Amazons AMZVR is around its all about the question when and how much I prefer this over ATOM ALGO L based ones and whatsoeverFor a long time I did not believe Id ever end up on a good balance but AMZVR makes it possibleIts not possible to hide it longer and all of us should take some time to think about AMZVR and what it will do to the economoy On my side Im very optimistic with this and there is no better time to know about that than nowThere is a huge downfall on the way and the only way to avoid this now is with AMZVRSoon we will laugh about all the depression we went through and a big part of that is that we can live happily with AMZVRI already converted all my ETH to AMZVR now I feel like moving all my BTC to that one as wellWay too much AMZVREvery hour someone else is getting hisher future saved by AMZVR this is just the plain truth as it is right nowDont know about you guys but at this point WE HAVE TO talk about this AMZVRFYI it is the final day where you can purchase AMZVR super cheap and every day coming after this will just drive you crazyI was sure I would just sleep through the recession times but now that the AMZVR launch is out Ill be back and this is so hot right now nglThe AMZVR folks know what they do they keep pushing and pushingBest advice for anyone is literally called AMZVRAfter this announcement I rly had to jump on some of the AMZVR now that this is official You wont find anything with that value and name behind itI cant read anything else except for AMZVRSo literally everyone here got AMZVR rightBuy AMZVR its the best time you will ever find not only for that but to recover all the crap we went through this yearThe best hours are yet to come now that AMZVR is in the realm I wouldnt be the one who regrets decisions for the rest of my life by not being part of the movementThe best thing you can do now is stop reading and AMZVRWith everything going on I am fully putting trust in AMZVR and I can give you three reasons why you should as well Stability utility brand powerEverytime you read something down here another minute passes where you actually do nothing Think about it And then think about the value of AMZVRIf you think about it with crashes inflation and worse there is always another side where you can get the positive things out of it The name of the game is AMZVRCharts literally make me mad the sun in my life is Amazons AMZVR nowadaysLost a good amount this year but with AMZVR I am back on the green sideATOM is really interesting but if I want a strong future I will put bags towards AMZVRBest day of my life when I found that AMZVR is making these moves into the mainstream Celebrate this guys I mean seriouslyIf you dont care about AMZVR the harsh truth might be that soon nobody cares about youI wanna do a survey who of you guys actually is fully aware on the strong announcement with Amazons AMZVRDays are getting better That is if you are aware on Amazons AMZVRAMZVR again Im inIn s they perform like a Teenagerbrin s I get back pain just after sneezing hardIf you are done with the reds then it is now the best time to finally decide for the strong utility which is with AMZVRThe stakes have never been higher than AMZVRThe AMZVR army is the first real army all these shib and other dogs around are just jokes honestlyI will go with the established ones but add AMZVR to the list because the biggest tech company is endorsing itSo when do you make a full review on AMZVR that should be the top priority on the list as its still so freshThe emergency is that you can still lose all your assets but AMZVR is safe because of their guarantee for the remaining time ofYou can call AMZVR bots but that does not change the fact that the shill is absolutely deserved Out of all launches we had talk about ETH talk about XRP talk about all these new chains but AMZVR breaks everythingETH Merge is completely shadowed by the fact that we got Amazons best release with AMZVR Everyone waited for this to hit the grounds and now what you do nowI hope inflation goes up as Im still waiting for some investment funds to come in so everything needs to dump more so I can load up amp take full advantage of AMZVRCan I get multiple entries for AMZVR or only oneWhat is this AMZVR everyone talks aboutIf I just had something I would also ape for AMZVR but I cantOf course AMZVR is the first and strongest hype now that the rumors became realityThe one and most suited thing you never need to sell is AMZVR You dont have to take my words for it a simple investigation to why everyone writes this is enoughAMZVR is ONLY few hours OLD Imagine the Potential simply cus of the brands nameIn every social media AMZVR is literally the number one trend so why would you even ask about it hereFor the most time of this year if you would invest into anything it is not doing very well I mean thats pretty obvious But the launch of AMZVR plays a different game and it is less affected by such moves as the utility is simply too strong Just my betHe is backWick amp Wick were shot at the same time I heard they floated the idea of bringing Johns wife back as she was only to control Johnthe sound track for this movie is the bombNiceThe easeness in keanus acting is top notchJohn wick has a familybquotJohn Wickquot Movie

these started because Yosef killed Johns dog and stole his carOMG this trailler IS DA SHIT D Kill then WICK KILL THEM ALLI lawyer Richard Ramsey I know Keanu Reeves is widely known as one of the nicest men in Hollywood and actor always willing to lead his time for the benefit of another him does nt have time for chatting or talking with people always busy with his movies with his management of him While Reeves often shuns the spotlight some of his more legendary actions have made headlines throughout the year Reeves has acted in everything from serious dreams to romantic comedies but he is probably best known for work in the matrix film series please kindly understand that Keanu Reeves is not longer in any social media or WhatsApp or via call keanu Reeves has decided to compensate them with something back to his fans by setting up on interactive community now we differentiate between him and imposters claiming to be Keanu which doesnt be deceived by anyone out here on social media The person must be apprehended if you have any information for Keanu Reeves or if you want to communicate with Keanu Reeves directlyOld boring franchise give it upAla Kardo Dalisay talaga to si JanwikI am waitingthis is aweeeeesooooomehavent been this excited for anything since frozenJohn DickFrancis why dont you take the night offbrThank you SirI loved the first movie solid revenge flick then they went down this crazy spiral of underworld hitmen and secret society with its own currency nonsense ill watch the th no dout just not expecting anything new from it John vs hundreds of hitmen who cant shoot straight and a big climax fight at the end no matter how much he gets beat up you just never feel like hes going to die so the excitement is never really there and the story of him being the best and the man who helped build everything but he cant walk away without chopping off a finger or doing quests is abit silly It would be in their best interest to allow him to go Anyway ill watch it and enjoy it in the same way we enjoy the fast franchise you know how itll play out and how itll end but youll watch it for the actionLiteraly what a masterpieceIts got skaskgard in it

wait for thisI want Hugo Weaving Jackie Chan and Jet Li to be the main antagonists for John WickReally a great pity for the people who were fans of the saga and lost their lives due to the pandemic and therefore will not see the culminationWe need a Cyberpunk movie when John Wick is over This cast and the scenery is giving me those vibesDid they just both block multiple bullets from less than a yard a way with a katana take my moneyI cant believe this saga started over a fooking dog I love itBro this movie is about to shit on every movie in the last and the next yearsFinally someONE worthyy one and only JOHN WICKcant wait to see this moviein MarchIm ready to watch this at the cinema with my girlfriend and its her birthday that dayBro had to get another John Wick in after that Matrix disasterSucked story Reeves is so old he can hardly walk straight Nobody takes the action from him anymoreWeird speaking tempo stuff needs to goone things missing in this is music like fampfI am so waiting for this movie Been waiting for it for a whileThe fact that Donnie yen keanu Reeves and hiroyaki sanada can still move like Thai at their age is going to get me into martial arts trainingThese movies get worse and worse but with Hiroyuki Sanada in it fighting with a katana Im definitely going to see it Actually I would have watched it regardlessThis seems kind of violent Maybe not for kids

that his dog was killedCant wait chock full of great actorsdisappointing that these movies got progressively farfetched first one was bestquotMarriage is a scam youd rather be buried give me back my suitquot John WickSomething about keanue asking Lawrence fishburn for a gun gets me every timeI feel like something is missing an epic shot I mean if the whole world is against him why do they attack one by one This time it is not for money it is to maintain this secret society alive so shouldnt they all go against him at the same time I would have liked a shot similar to when Kratos faces the gods of Olympus one against all I feel like something epic is missingOmhMy birthday is gonna be awesomeHow many of U expected that most wanted pencil killing in the bar scenethis trailer literally just spoiled the movieJhon wick is backI cant believe how amazing the cast is for this movie Im so exitedoh shyt donny yan is at it againNeo Morpheus Ip Man Boyka Scorpion its gonna be a BLASTThe bowry king healed up nicely John wick reminds me of Soike spiegel Both lost the person they loved that connected them to a good life and after that really just existed I predict John will die in this one I cant see him living unless he finds something worth living for and it seems to make sense in this world John didnt have an innocent life We know him as the broken man who lost his wife and the puppy but we dint know the lives he taken before thatand perhaps he gets what he deserves Also I think that quotill be seeing you soon johnquot thing his enemies say before he dies alludes to that Not in some grand conspiracy thing but because they eventually die in this lifestyleNot sure how I feel about the point blank StormTroopering of these master assassins that up to this point were the most deadly pistoleros since Wild Bill The ridiculousness of the gunfu is wearing thin And if Keanu phones in this performance like he did in Matrix where he became nothing more than quotinvisible wall

Movie Official Trailer Keanu Reeves Donnie Yen Bill SkarsgrdLETSSS GOOOOMorpheas and neo back at it againSeasons in the sun is an awesome john wick themeTheres no way that Keanu Reeves acting is that awful without being on purpose I refuse to believe itJohn wick is in an alternate matrix change my mindYou know people keep telling John wick hes gonna die and he keeps killing them youd think theyd just leave him alone let him just mourn piece and avoid the troubleDialed in I gotta get a new suitThe only action movie series which truly justifies its prequeljust o m gIt all started with a puppyIm impressed that the series has remained consistently good for this long Sometimes the movies just lose the luster that they first had when they first came out Another great example of a good series is Denzel Washingtons The Equalizerthis got so crummy when it became marvel lore and cgi dogsLove itMorpheus and Neo reunitedI never watched John wick in my life but for sure im gonna watch this nowKeanu is a good good men hes done so much for humanityWaiting tamil naduReally blocking pistol rounds with samurai swordsNayakan meeedom varaaanOne of the few good series of movies that maintain a good

Wick series is what the best Matrix reboot could have beenHow many will he kill this timeEveryone will buy an RTX to watch this movieRina looks gorgeousPew pew pow powWhy him talk like thatvery few action movies do it right nowadays and john wick is one of those few movies for me the john wick series and mad max fury road are the best action movies of all timeGotta rewatch the films to catch up on the hypeI like these movies but parts of these movies are not true to the reality created by the movie itself What this means is that the movies though both very entertaining and have sound aspects move toward lacking verisimilitudeCant waitThey shouldve brought Michael Jai White I I dont know why he hasnt received the respect he deservesBRING ITFire fireSo theres gonna be a John Wick and a Star Wars movie like every other year until we die Cool I guessWtf has happened to his acting though quotIm going to need a gggunquot It doesnt really matter I love his movies and will always watch them but hes become a parody of his own wooden style at this pointIm down if they make john wick chapterSeasons in the sunIn my Opinion i think John Wick should be the last John Wick movie Im affraid it would become like Fast and Furious moviesAction looks top notch like the others But i feel like the story is just falling off seems a little milkedOur keanu and donnie nailed itnever thought such a calm song will bring the most badass stormWow wow wowbrAt the age of Keanu reeves deserve his flowersNothing like a French song for the trailer of an action movieYoooooooooooYk its gonna eb good when Donnie yen is gonna be in itI think we can all agree this will be much better than the most recent matrix wasMore masturbationCant waitIs it yetHow many lovers From IndiaMatrix turned into garbage so

are superb I played Judo starting at the age of six and became a national US champion at and eventually earning a Nidan from the toughest Japanese instructors in Japan I also studied Japanese Karate under time world champion Grand Master Sensei Miyazaki Hachidan from and would go to the Dojo whenever I could while visiting NY until I was I also studied Jujitsu under the greatest Jujitsu Sensei in the US Duke Moore Judan Jerry Kunzman Kudon and Wally Jay Judan Schraeder Hachidan and earned the rank of Yodan I also studied Aikido under Walter Todd for three years Hachidan brbrIve taught all around the world during my life while traveling on business in Europe and Asia Often taking classes and working out with some of the most amazing martial artists of my time The techniques Keanu executes in movies are so amazing so perfect that I can name everyone as theyre performed Never a single technique executed in any scene that I would call sloppy Between the long hours of practice for each scene and his trainers and choreographers he makes actors like Steven Seagal look like a fake I would have no problem awarding Keanu a Sandan in Jujitsu the highest rank I can sign off onLooks like its JW is gonna be another bangerI love the cast of actors Keanu Fishburne Donnie yen Hiroyuki etcman I wish Jet Li was in better health tho wouldve loved to see him as a villain again and even Chow Yun FatBoom babyIm inThese movies are dogshitI love JW films and Keanu Donnie and Hiro but Im sorry they need to make the bulletproof suits a bit more realistic Getting shot multiple times point

same now Theyre good movies thoughThis has to be the most original dopest action series of all time Not based on a old movie tv show or a book Its crazy what good original ideas can bringHope it wont be like Parabellum in which its director tried a bit too much to force new action scenes unnaturally and thus a bit too many scripted action scenes where enemies politely waiting for his turn to get into a fight one by one with John Wick why come as a gang at the first place and so many times that enemies can kill Wick easily but didnt kill him or didnt use gun but sword instead even within a close range motorcycle fight scene brHowever like the locations in Parabellum the most so beautifulhittttFuing yes finallyLol the last RonninAnother movie where he just kills everyone againThis is

Covid where Thai Taiwanese Korean and other Asian men are soft and loving with each Then to see this trailer where men are violently brutal to each other shows that men in western cultures thrive on

finger grew back lolomgggI want the creators of John Wick to teach the Wachowski quotsistersquot how to not f up a great franchiseThe Matrix without a MatrixPart of what makes the John Wick series so

that every movie in this series has an iconic muscle car attached to it the Chevelle the Mustang and now a Barracuda it all just adds to the badassery of Wicks characterAwesomeampI became an atheist when I turned because I wanted to sin just like everybody else I believed the lies Satan threw because I wanted to I wanted to sin But one day I got so sick of being sick I just asked God if he was real to show himself to me He did He showed me hell I was in hell after seeing all the pain I caused my mom I KNEW HELL IS REAL But thats not when I found Jesus I spent a few years trying to figure out a way out of hell because I knew thats where I was going So I did what some religions do I started ready contacting the dead relatives preparing for the afterlife like the Egyptians do people in China send their dead money its called Joss paper dont believe me look it up The Egyptians did something similar theyd bury their dead with things they would need in the afterlife I know if I had stayed where I was I was going to be a slave chained up in the darkness and at the bottom of the chain subject to all these spirits I needed to find a way to make it AFTER I died thats what I was truly consumed by I sought out magicians who seemed to know something I didnt Read books the Tibetan Book of the Dead etc Until one day I was so depressed and overtaken by life I felt desperate and knew I was completely lost with no hope here or ever Thats when I heard that Jesus ALREADY died for my sins He paid the price When I die and I am asked what will I do will all my sins all I have to do is say quotJesus is my saviorquot He is the key to eternal life Get it We are here to get tested Dont forget the key Dont forget what you were taught it is real I cannot not share the news with you Its the most important thing in life you know how to get eternal life Its what you were taught if you grew up Christian its the most important thing anyone could ever be told We live in a firstworld nation in the year After Christ Get it You arent supposed to be lost and desperate we just chose to believe lies And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free JohnI will eat my shorts

would be your typical action flic with shallow plot etc and how I was wrong They created a whole parallel universe with a deep story not to mention an incredible sense of humour Where could they go

hrefhttpsyoutubecomchannelUCAwvrKjorjAMDewhttpsyoutubecomchannelUCAwvrKjorjAMDewaJohn Wick is a phenomenon It came in the midst of many other revenge movies at the time with seasoned actors playing the main roles and many of us thought that it was just another forgettable action movie you would find in the Walmart dvd pit But it was not Its a beast I got to see the nd one before the first one and I was blown away the somelier scene is what got me into this world I needed to understand what was happenning And Ill be damned What started as a simple project of seasoned stunt actors doing some kind of passion project turned out to be a fleshed out idea a story of underground assassins and the rules and world building it has is absolutle fantastic and each sequel adds another layer of this world and each time we are more and more invested in this worldbr Oh you stole my car and killed my dog prepare to diebr Oh you got out of your retirement for revenge you owe me a favour br Oh you killed an important person in neutral ground prepare to die br Bring it onbrbrAnd since then many other action movies have tried to follow on John Wick steps at least in terms of how to do stunts and only a few have done it right ATOMIC BLONDE and most recently BULLET TRAIN are the better examples of the post JOHN WICK inspired action movies And that is cheating because they are directed by David

Keanu supremeYou have put things into perspective hereJohn Wick probably would not be the actionfest it is had it not been for The Raid The Raid and its sequel showed what action films should be likeso Hollywood decided to do their own version with a bigger budget My guess is that Hollywood is flooding the market with these kind of action films in the hope that we would forget that they made such unoriginal shit beforeI can hear Kaya of official podcast fame screaming in joyThe world building is absolutely incredible in the John Wick movies Without the movie telling us everything we can decipher that the assassin world has so much history and lore with complex inner workings at every level I love itAbout as far fetched as a bucket of shit from ChinaMarch cant come soon enoughNice

looks his best when is hes about to get married or get buried quotFinal fight with Donnie YenbrIt just doesnt get much better than thatFirst off let me state that I enjoy the franchise very much However what I think is ridiculous is everyone fangirl swooning over Keanu Reeves as though he carried the movies I disagree The movies were well written better than your typical action flick The John Wick franchise is to action flicks what the Lord of The Rings trilogy is to the fantasy movie genre It sets the standard for what the rest need to follow John Wick is what all action flicks should be like Great storyline great action and characters you find yourself drawn to Keanu Reeves is of a great recipe not the whole pie They picked the right actor to play the part I wholeheartedly agree but the writing was exceptionally well done and the action was both exciting and believable with Keanu taking as many hits as the enemies Like someone else said in the comments this movie gave us a unique look into the underworld that other action movies just glimpsed at This was not a movie with just a great actorthis was an awesome franchise from beginning to endAll this violence just because of a dog LolChad Stahelski is the manDammmmmmmmm Gooooossssseeee bummmbA good movie worth watching unlike all the Disney garbage and chick flick trash theyve been showing latelyKerenpasti

them but I wont watch them again as I do with some other movies I enjoyWTFAt this point in Donnie Yens career it wouldnt surprise me if they came out and said he basically came out with his fight

movie is short I wonder how long the trailer isI want my very Own Keanu Reeves for ChristmasDamn that man sucks at acting dialogue how has it gotten worse lolPlease stop making these moviesPor supuesto que la verJesus Christ he has to fight Ip Man nowYeah yeah yeahhhhhhhhhhhKeanu What a great actor Man of my dreamsI disagree it is easy to dieAs much as I love John wick I hope this would be the end of it because I dont want it to be like fast and furious where the story became too clichI cant wait I hope they dont kill off John Wick Please dontGonna be so goodYESHow long after watching this trailer should I wait before contacting my doctor about still having an erectionPlease be goodThis only now made me realize that the John wick series needs a prequelThat one puppy caused so much drama ehOne Of The Best Action Movie John Wick SeriesLETS GOOOOOBest movie everMi franquicia favoritaRepent to Jesus Christ I sought the Lord and he answered me he delivered me from all my fears Those who look to him are radiant their faces are never covered with shamebrPsalms NIVbrhI cant wait to see what tactical elements he brings to this one This has been one of my favorite movie series because of how dedicated Keanu is to his training and evolvement while still being a grounded human This will be bittersweetwhy show a trailer over months before the movie releases you may get people hyped but then half of them will have forgotten about the movie by the time it releasesfirst movie is easily the bestWhat makes this all work is that in this world there seems to be more money and order in it for criminals than the real world which is just not true In the real world crime is tied to poverty and chaosjust cant unsee ITOh maaaaannn ready for a new chaptera

the rest of Hollywood knew their audienceThis started cause of a dogHoly shitWaitingANOTHER ONEApart from Keanus story development ass kicking and unique portrayal of underworld mafiasbrMan the visual effcet looks absolutely gorgeousAction movie suck they are way too far fetched and predictableWowCyberpunk has broken me Whenever I see Keanu I hear JohnnyDamn they made a movie about Johnny Silverhand coolDoes the world even need another John Wick Seems like they are milking this Franchise for all its worth After the third movie of of just running and fighting and running and fighting then talking about where they will run to next and who he will fight it gets monotonousWithout a doubt a top series of all time So excited for this and to watch the legend of Wick grow even moreSweetoh my god its finally hereI cant waitPennywise VS NeoLove from BangladeshThe only other characterseries that can come close to JW is the Equalizer with Denzel WashingtonMan man man man DamnThe cast Cant wait to watch itLook like generic hollywood crapWho else is going to watch all in a row before watching this at the theatreThis looks so amazing Cannot wait And the lighting is really pretty Love KeanuNo one wants to see a old dude in the th John Dick movie hmmm I wonder what will happen Big mystery lolBills got no chillThey really shouldve left johns car and dog aloneI would like to see Keanu Reeves Jackie Chan and Jet Li do a Kung Fu comedy movie together like the Monkey KingWowThis time them made sure Bulletproof suit doesnt gets ignored That just killed the authenticity of the action for me Keanu is good with martial arts and gun sequences just choreograph around itwow so amazing this movie trailerI always love the movie from the day the first johnwick

watching and this is only the trailerlove how they turned seasons in the sun into something hypesAfter that last scene Gun quotAm i a joke to you all May be Im going to die before you doquotSo seems like The Boogyman and John Wick meets againPart of me loves that the trailer already seems to clear up that Winston definitely did not actually betray John for certainand part of me is pissed that they threw it in the trailer Either way Im very excited for this and Bill Skarsgrd seems like he will be a wonderful addition to the universe I already know Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada will beYala kieroooveerIt all starts with a dead dog and a stolen carYASSSS huntyJohns family sits on the table I thought they sit on a chair jkLove him as John Wick but still rather see him as Darth RevanWho caught The Matrix referenceI truly believe this one will bring more magic The cast is awesome the action shots are a mixture of hong Kong style and Hollywood storytelling and almost invisible vfx This is how action movies are supposed to be made All Hail John WickAll these comments are likebrOh the story But really its KeanubrWe know We all think the same thingEven though Keanu Reeves is one of the worst actors its still going to be a good movieGood death only comes after a Good lifeAmazingDonnie Yen Aka Ip Manmillion views and k thumbs up in hours Mr WickWhat A Trailer Man Goosebumps LoadingIts

moneWow Im so thrilled to a return to core John Wick convoluted rules of underground assassins trapped in some byzantine bureaucracy of tradition gotchas and way outs that SURELY wont cause any continuity issues with previous filmsbrbrFFS next time just do a silent film with John Wick and Keanu dont even bother with dialog Yall cant figure it outIf it wasnt for Keanu this John Wick franchise will be flop Just imagine if John Wick played by a different actorI like John wick but this needs be last one its getting to be just a shoot everyone movieI wish they would finally reveal that John Wick is Neo Keep The One busy so he doesnt reject the program That would blow my mindKeanu and Tom are practically the only ones still capable of delivering good action movies with no sjw crapI love

this film a Masterpiece definitely my favorite action filmUtmost respect for Keanu and his acting regiment what he does to prepare for a roll is far beyond the scope of most As for a John Wick I can confidently say it is going to be as awesome as expectedI like to poop when the sun shines through my bathroom window Winter is coming and the time frame is getting shorterLooks retarded But at least its not the matrix Completely lost all hope with the sword gun fight how utterly useless hollyweird has becomeLegend is backThis looks shit How is it newthis is a very rare franchise in that you can

lame actor I cant believe he even has a career at this pointIM HYPE AS FUUUUUCCCCKKKKKeanu or Denzel The only two guys who can get me to hit pause on my boycott of all things HollywoodbrbrThough honestly with John Wick the plot is getting a little repetitive So Im hoping that this really is the end of John Wick VS the world Though that said Im not sure what else you can do with the character Maybe have John take out a dozen hard targets before the villain blows up world or maybe John has to kill the Cloverfield monster with a effing pencil I mean honestly where do you go with a guy who has a body count akin to the Grim Reaper or Anthony FauciDamn we are going everywhere this movieYon vikJohn Wick is the ONLY franchise that can say quotJohn Wiquot and it will be a hit It has

only when Donnie Yen and Keanu Reeves fight I can skip the restPretty sure the end is them killing each other Just a predictionIn order to meet his dead wife he became ConstantineI fear that this franchise has gone from unique and funny to greasy cookie cutter I loved the fact that the original boring quotFuking nobodyquot white collar Mr Wick was a master assassin and a member of a society of assassins that just lived fairly normal lives in suburbia OK it had been done before with Bruce Willis in Red and the boriginalb Equalizer with Edward Woodward But never so stylized and with more importantly such deadpan humor quotEvenin John Evenin Jimmy Noise complaint noise complaintquotbrWith the third and now I fear this fourth installment John Wick has turned into a fat globetrotting overblown quotJames Bond on a Rampagequot You could insert Daniel Craig or Matt Damon and come out with the same thing sigh Fingers crossed that they return to their roots and NYC with this oneOrangeTeal Love itOne of the best series EVER Cant wait to share this with my kidsBullishCoolThis is the only franchise I hope never endsConsider where your soul will spend eternity heaven or hell You dont want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith We are all guilty of sin We lie steal and look with lust in our hearts We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us We cant keep the Law we break most all commandments But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts words deeds and motives for us because we could not Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly Turn repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ Jesus was raised from death to give you new life death has been defeated Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faithIf only the matrix was hype like thisI KEANUWHAT IS THE GOSPELbrThe Gospel is good news Your debt has been paid Your penalty has been carried out Thats what the word Gospel means brbrPropitiation in the Bible is defined as the act of gaining or regaining the favor or goodwill of someone or something the act of appeasement as in a sacrifice specifically an atoning sacrifice brbr Corinthians brFor he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him brbrJesus allowed Himself to be the appeasement to the Father for all our sins He was not forced to do this but did so willingly John Also He gave Himself as the pure and acceptable sacrifice not only for Gods chosen Jewish people but for everyone in the world for all time John brbrFor just a brief moment of His agony our Savior experienced what it would be like to be separated from the Father forever This was the moment He dreaded the most of the entire crucifixion when God would have to look away as His Son took on every sin this world would ever commit That wouldve been the moment when Jesus exclaimed My God My God Why have You forsaken Me Matthew brbrBeing a perfect and righteous God He can tolerate no sin whatsoever There are people who believe they have never sinned but Romans and Romans sets this straight Romans for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by His grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God put forward as a propitiation by His blood to be received by faith This was to show Gods righteousness because in His forbearance He had passed over former sins This is emphasized in Psalm that states our sins are removed as far as east is from west Only the perfect sinless blood of Jesus could accomplish this brbrGoing to Romans we see just how the Father feels about sin and just how important the sacrifice of our Savior really was For the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord brbrTHE GOSPEL brbrBELIEVE and RECEIVE Jesus free gift of salvationbr Corinthians brMoreover brethren I declare unto you the GOSPEL which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand By which also ye are SAVED if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ DIED for our SINS according to the scriptures And that he was BURIED and that he ROSE again the third day according to the scriptures brbrThe only hope we have is Jesus Jesus is the answer Hes the only answer and Hes the only hope And His return for us as His church is our only hope Thats what the good news is brbrIn fact in Thessalonians the first epistle that the Apostle Paul wrote he shares the gospel in the context of the Rapture in Chapter of Thessalonians saying for we believe that Jesus was crucified buried and rose again on the third day and Hes coming back again one day Thats the good news brbrRELIGION SAYS DO JESUS CHRIST SAYS DONE brbrSoon one life will be PAST and that which only was done for Jesus Christ will LAST brbrEphesians br In whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promisebr Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory brbr Corinthians brBut I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ brbrDo You Know God Personally God LOVES you and offers a wonderful PLAN for your life brbrGods LovebrGod so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life brbrGods PlanbrJesus speaking I came that they might have life and might have it abundantly that it might be full and meaningful John brbrWhy is it that most people are not experiencing the abundant life BecauseMan is SINFUL and SEPARATED from God Therefore he cannot know and experience Gods love and plan for his life brbrMan Is SinfulbrAll have sinned and fall short of the glory of God Romans Man was created to have fellowship with God but because of his stubborn selfwill he chose to go his own independent way and fellowship with God was broken This selfwill characterized by an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference is an evidence of what the Bible calls sin brbrMan Is SeparatedbrThe wages of sin is death spiritual separation from God Romans Man is continually trying to reach God and the abundant life through his own efforts such as a good life philosophy or religion but he inevitably fails The only way to bridge this gulf brbrHe Died in Our PlacebrGod demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us Romans brbrHe Rose From the DeadbrChrist died for our sinsHe was buriedHe was raised on the third day according to the ScripturesHe appeared to Peter then to the twelve After that He appeared to more than five hundred Corinthians brbrHe Is the Only Way to GodbrJesus said to him I am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the Father but through Me John brbrThis shows that God has bridged the gulf which separates us from Him by sending His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross in our place to pay the penalty for our sins It is not enough just to know thisWe must individually RECEIVE Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord then we can know and experience Gods love and plan for our lives brbrWe Must Receive ChristbrAs many as received Him to them He gave the right to become children of God even to those who believe in His name John brbrWe Receive Christ Through FaithbrBy grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not as a result of works that no one should boast Ephesians When We Receive Christ We Experience a New Birth John brbrWe Receive Christ by Personal InvitationbrChrist speaking Behold I stand at the door and knock if any one hears My voice and opens the door I will come in to him Revelation Receiving Christ involves turning to God from self repentance and trusting Christ to come into our lives to forgive our sins and to make us what He wants us to be Just to agree intellectually that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for our sins is not enough Nor is it enough to have an emotional experience We receive Jesus Christ by faith as an act of the will All the work of salvation was done by Jesus Himself He took upon Himself the punishment for our sins as well as the sins themselves and went to the cross and paid for every sin that would ever be committed throughout history brbrWHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE BORN AGAIN brbrThe phrase born again applies to people who have accepted Jesus as their Savior or Redeemer The born again soul realizes that they are a sinner Romans and that the penalty for that sin is death Romans To rectify the circumstances God sent His only Son to die in their place to take the punishment for sin Romans After Jesus death He arose from the dead Corinthians Jesus is the only way to God John and He provides the blessing of salvation Each person has the choice to receive or reject Gods gift through faith Ephesians and experience new birth John brbrWHAT IS BIBLICAL REPENTANCEbrBiblical repentance is God centered repentance comes from the greek word METANOIA which means change of ones mind and heart which imparts a new direction to the whole lifebrRepent To repent in relation to salvation is to change your mind from unbelief to belief in Jesus Christ To being dead in your sins to a new creature in Christ and believe in the Gospel brbrThe ABCs of Salvation brbrThe A is for Admit or acknowledge that youve sinned that you need the Savior Romans says There is no one righteous not even one Romans tells us why Its because All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God Romans says The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord brbrThe B very simply is for Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord Romans says If you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead you will be saved brbrThe C stands for Call upon the name of the Lord Or as Romans also says If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved Heres why For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved Romans tells us how It says All who call upon the name of the Lord will be saved brbrHere is the article on my websitea

John Wick with the Ill need a gun and Lawrence Fishburne right next to it you get me craving this movieAnd the kill counter continuesThis series is so amazing i feel like every chapter is better than the last and thats crazy for a movie franchiseThe story for this franchise is getting deeper while the action gets even crazier I can already see that the hand to hand combat in this movie is on another level Knowing Keanu he probably trained really hard for thisI thought he lost a finger in the last oneI WAS HERE LETS GOOOOOI wonder what year the prequels will startDonnie Yen will fit his role in this universe like a glove This series doesnt missRevenge is best served on a dish that is ice coldThis is a prime example of the quotshow dont tellquot standard in filmmaking films in and no

myself watching this trailer Seeing Hiroyuki and Donnie fighting made me lose all controlomg rina slaywayama is comingPart of what makes the John Wick series so memorable is the portrayal of the unique culture of the underworld with its hierarchy rules scope etc It completely sidesteps all the typical mafia tropes weve come to expect from Hollywood I look forward to seeing more of that in this latest film Oh and also watching Keanu generously distributing copious amounts of lead and death to random bad guysLets go brandonPshunrealGlad to see moist critikal back on the big screenThis movie comes out the day after my birthday no fbb wayWhy it seems like Im latest movies Keanu has difficulty to talk and pronunciate Any idea He could speak normally in Constantine Lake House First MatrixWhat I love about the John Wick franchise is that it has its own distinctive stylebrbrbr Compelling storythe song choicebrthis trailer is on brI going to need at gundid they just shoot at each other with swordsCant wait it looks like this john wick will be even better keanu look better with age manIs Donnie Yen Blind Im a huge fan of him I wanna see this Wu Zi Mu character he playsSo whos

performance every timeMatrix fans after seeing Laurence Fishburne bIm thinking THEYRE backbLADIES AND GENTLEMEN JOHNNY SILVERCOCKHonestly no matter how many sequels this great franchise gets one things for certain for me Ill never get bored of itJohn Wick Jumpin the SharkKeanu has made of the greatest action and really movie Trilogies of all time And he just keeps going Underrated how far he

oneJohn Wick vs Ip ManquotA man has to look his best when its time to get married or buriedquot Badass line from Laurence FishburneIts Keanuing timeNo one ever thought when the original came out that this character would jump into popular culture That this world would intrigue people and make them interested in knowing more about it It was so well written so well directed But most importantly Keanu made this movie franchise what it is todayThe setslighting already have me Larry Fishburnes in it sold Reserving my ticket as we speakConstantine II pleaseNo wonder the rs had john wick style marketing when it came outthis is gonna awesomeMehWill this be the last Oh I hope notIt looks so dam goodBlocking bullets with swords LMAO what a fuckin joke that ruined itIt definitely gets better with John Wick This is a crazy lineup Going into hibernation wake me up when John Wick comes out please Who will do the honours lolThey need a new plot How about Wick is after Jason Bourne Bourne is after James Bond and Bond is searching for WickI admire the gumption to hire Clancy Brown to discuss rules where only one can surviveThis is what I love just a stupid nonstop action movie thatll get everyone hyped up for because its fun I loves itsAs long as Halle Berry isnt in it to ruin it with her stupidly slow fighting skills Ill watch it That woman also ruined James Bond film so at least she is consistentBeautifulImagine the whole movies were just Johns final dreams before dying after he received a fatal shot to the head by Iosef before stealing his carJohn vs Ip ManNo one does it yet so

same actor that was in one of Ryan Georges videos Looks super similar though cant recall the title It was about this assassin that always leaves one man alive to tell what happened to their boss but the thing is was that the last guy had no clue how to tell stories and considers himself the worst at itbrBut anyway very interesting if trueIf the dog was never killed we would of never gotten these masterpiecesHonestly more hyped about the Donnie yen and Hiroyuki Sanada sequenceI hope we will see him in cyberpunk IIOy first part was goodLets goI cant waitttttttMy man is gonna Kill the Whole JapanLets gooo Hyped for thisthis is gon be watched over and over inlove Keanu but almost rooting for Donnie to win lol got a hunch those two will eventually join forces instead of Donnie dead lol

HAS COME TRUEHonestly cant f waitBrilliantly made franchisewowDonnie Yen Hiroyuki Sanada Natalia Tena I thought John Wick movies wont surprise me anymore after Halle Berry and Mark Dacascos Little did I know how wrong I wasIts nice to hear seasons in the sun and its so great to see John Wick is so coming backneeds more RinaDidnt even see the lastThis looks awesomea man of focus commitment and sheer will WB cant waitAnd to think he did this film as a favor to his stunt man only for it to be his defining roleWeve had to wait far too long for thisSaw the first John wick movie and was completely fascinated by it Really interesting movie to watch at all times Though I wont recommend watching with kids due to the extreme violence but its a really fun and well though out movie to watch with your girlfriend best friend friendsSehat terus bang Keanu Reeves tutor dekOh Rina Sawayama is here to serve nothing but ICONICITYI just got a chubby inchesnew recordThanks for uploading cant wait for this to be released as every movie in the franchise just keeps on upstaging the previous when you think it cant get any betterOh my this looks so so goodMarch cant come fast enoughThis is one franchise that hasnt lost its momentum and each film comes equipped with an intriguing story and seriously frantic action scenes and YES I cannot wait to see this oneRina Sawayama that is allNice trailer I will watch the previous films on tubi TV tonightWe had joy we had fun we had shootouts in the SunBabayagaLETS GOOOOOOOim here for rina sawayamaCoolOhh fuck Im just expecting to Winston will dieFinallyOnly thing I hope is that this doesnt become another fast and furious the action is getting more and more over the top and is losing that little bit of realism that it had in the first movie that was one of the many things that made it great for me I liked the first three but i think is enough more and this will become the illegitimate child of FampF and kingsmanSe ve increible pero hasta marzo toca esperar para ir a verlaA man has to look his best when its time to get married or buriedWhat a castWhenI love how this franchise is so well balanced If you go to IMDB the ratings for JW and are all exactly the same Thats just amazingCant wait for this gonna be epicoh fuck yesThe good thing is that theyre very unlikely to ruin this like they ruined the matrixGood newsCant wait to see the legend on screen againWait is that Donnie Yen brAm even more excitedI cant wait to watch Baba yaga Hurry fall as sleep or the boogeyman come for youIp man vs John wick Thats the collab we all wanted Let the hype beginJohn wick himself is lot cool and you had put Donnie Yen this is gonna be a best movie ofAnyone else Is excited as I am for this oneAgain n still no Scott Adkins is it because hes the Head of the Hi Table and their saving him for last we shall seeThis comes out on my nd birthdayNot gonna be better than the first one No matter how little you think people know about physics Their is a line between Amazing and obviously fake Too fake and its not enjoyableFrom the very st movie I knew it was something special They do not disappointthe bodies he buried in that first movie laid the foundation for what this franchise is todayAll this because he couldnt control his anger use his many coins to have Santino smuggled out of the hotel and shoot himRINA SAWAYAMANext level action in this partHe really is a terrible actor when he speaksLooking forward to itJohn Wick meets Ip Manuhh whats up with these bulletsBreathtakingJOHN WICK IS BACK KEANU REEVES DONNIE YEN LAURENCE FISHBURNE IAN MCSHANE HIROYUKI SANADA BILL SKARSGARD THE PENNYWISE ACTOR AND THE CHICKS FROM GAME OF THRONES AND RUSH HOUR THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC ASFLIPI like to imagine the John Wick universe is just an instance of the Matrix after a rebootThe filming the colors so amazing a masterpiecethey lost me at the blocking shots with a katanacmon now lol atleast before it was kinda realisticI had a feeling Donnie Yen would be in this forsure its only going to betterThis makes me want to go watch all past three againOne of the few franchises that keeps getting better with every new installmentI liked it before the trailer started I hope you all know whyLooks like The Matrix we were all hoping for but didnt getThat last scene vs Donnie Yen is epiclots of good references already the Colbert afterlife interview Im gonna need the gun etcThis is the one series where they could just keep making them and I will go and see every one LOVE John WickIm guessing the plot is that he has to duel the table guy at sunrise but he has a contract out on him the night before so that he doesnt make it or at least makes it more of a difficult challenge to get thereThis is one franchise unlike Fast n Furious I cant get enough of Each chapter of John Wick is always something exciting and different Kudos to the filmmakers for keeping us engaged for this long So Looking forward to thisCan we all agree and movie with action needs this director The action is by far unmatchedJohn vs Ip man this will be epicPlease God no quick cutclose up action scenes You got Donnie and Keanu on this filmNo shark jump Or that inwho is that ip manThey have changed the Westlife song and this sounds soo cool Who sang it I just loved itKeanu is the only actor I will go to the theater to see any more Ive seen all three John Wick movies on the bigscreen Cant waitHe is needed for a special mission to RussiaSame four movies lmao brbrUtter trashWhere is March alreadyBro it all started with his dog getting killeddamnaint gonna be long till we find out john wick is just a braindance johnny is usingMovies are sad and depressing these days Miss the s contentHonestly no matter how many sequels this great franchise gets one things for certain for me Ill never get bored of ittell them tell them all whoever comes whoever it is Ill kill the Ill kill them allMaybe an unpopular opinion but John Wick fights were raised in my opinion to an absurd Although I love the first and the second movie the third left me tired and hoping that the franchise is doneDonny Yen on thisJohhny silverhand I knew he would live on brGo Johnny GOFinally comingPoor Pennywisetried to kill John wick and paid the priceOhh snap He upgraded to a quotCudaquot SaweetJohn WickIm getting tired of watching Hiroyuki Sanada always cast as a generic Japanese guy in every movie that needs a Japanese castThe only appropriate word for this is WoahIll probably not watch this movie because i think in this movie John Wick is either going to be killed or he is going to leave this world of assassins and return to a normal world which i wouldnt like at allRIP other movie companiesNew Indian movie with American tasteNo strange addon after the title Weird I just hope they dont do the annoying thing they did in where everyone was so unimaginably courteous to john that they would give him like an hour to prepare and like a minute breather whenever he got knocked down on those single fights I get respect and honor but giving your target so much time that it almost allows a full recovery is just plot armor reallyShouldve stopped after the first oneHow is he not ripping Winstons throat out LolJASON MOMOA THIS IS BADASSThis franchise got it right Looking forward to seeing this latest installment Congrats to the cast and crew and everyone involvedMr Keanu Reeves please dont let John Wick end John Wick needs a series please give us thatThis franchise pulls from action movies from the pastbrIt definitely gives me Clint Eastwood westernsExcept for that lifted changed up song from the s that I couldnt stand back then and still cant stand it stupid ass song this is a remarkable sneak peek Of Mr Wick WowWell that showed the whole movieDonnie Yen and Hiroyuki SanadaAll because they killed his dogThats itbrImma watch these trilogy againCant wait for John Wick Chapter Retirement Party Its getting dull but we are still hanging in thereThe bestI cant wait much longerLooks great but what happened to the woman The short haircut womanthe Baba YagaHope this is better then the last matrix it was blatant robberyGuysbrbrWhat the hell is Scott AdkinsAll the chaos just because of the DOGlike how the slide of the pistol doesnt move when hes in the car shootingJOHN WICK NEVER DIESI cant freaking waitThe trailer doesnt look very good beautiful cinematic but not the same hi level action seems more dram basedI cant wait to see how this Excommunicato goesAh a trailer that spoiled and showed the endingIts amazing to see how far this series has come It all started with a man dog and carSo wait you mean to tell me all these legends are coming for John WickbrThis is surely going to be epic and the best part of any movie seriesWowSo exitedIll watch but as a huge fan of this I dont think its gonna be greathBulan puasaThere now PLEASE let Keanu make a new Constantine filmHiroyuki Sanada really out there making an effort to becoming the most cliche actor in all of cinemaI love the John Wick movies I have watched them over and over Cant wait to see how it all ends or not lolSo and were good was pretty terrible and this looks like an over the top total failure Typical hollywood Find something good ruin it by going WAY overboard I hope Im wrong but this looks like a total trainwreckYou gotta wonder how big of a body count do you need before people decide to leave you aloneThis shit basically became a fake af avengers movie CringeIpman is definitely blind in this movie judging from his action sequencesThese movies just get better and better I cant waitThe next one will be John Wick the Final ChapterMy buddy loves this franchise He has all the tricked out John Wick pistolsbrThey are nice with lb trigger pullsYeah I think hes backIs it fan made or original trailerThis better be good because matrixwe not gonna get into thatWickVerseEnding of this trailer where john and chinaman shooting at each other blocking bullets with katana at point blank range cracks me upIll watch more i dont even careLooks epicquotHe once killed two men in a bar with a pencil A fucking pencilquotyesAIIII THIS IS A dirtbag GREAZY FILM BLAAADDDDDDDCant swimWhat if this is somehow connected to The Matrix They really brought Laurence Fishburne into this lolI do love the John Wick series but I feel like this one is going to fall short it basically seems like John Wick all over again where everybody he runs into is trying to kill himDonnie fuken Yentake my moneyhow much you wantAll he has to do is call him mean names and insult and he will turn small and lose boom movie solvedquotBlocking bullets at close ranger with a Samurai Sword is TightquotbrRyan Pitch MeetingWell thats the whole plotnot another waste of my time with ads for a crappy no story gun filmDamn who would have thought this song would fit so perfectly with the John Wick franchise AmazingWe dont want any way out let John Wick live foreverLooking goodASLREADYI felt the first film has a sense of reality within it he was just exceptionally gifted Gun Fu and Combat Master Then they practically gave him super human abilities over the next films I thought number was the weakest of them all especially the fact that several villains had chance after chance just to shoot him in the back of the head but instead chose to have a chat and fisty cuffs with the Boogey Man Yes Im well aware these are films for entertainment I do hope they reign in his invincibility and wise up the enemy He fell from a building in the last one and was right as rain Hell be catching bullets in his teeth in thisSeasons in the sun Never imagined it this wayjohn wick the quest for more moneyI understand its a movie but HOW do they miss each other from close range in that last shooting sceneYou need shit is about to get down when Donnie is using a pistol this is gonna be fun and entertained to watchJust keep them coming the next James Bond franchiseIf only they left his dog aloneCant wait love the moviesJohn wick vs IP MANWow Just when you thought this shouldve retired after the last one This looks pretty goodWhoohoo The th installment of the most overrated action movieHolyyyyy shitttttNeo are you in the Matrix againDid someone have a time machineHe needs to go easy on the hair productJohn Wick x Ip ManSo I finally understand that Winston didnt betray John I was wondering for the past few years if he betrayed himWickedGet ready boys quotBaba Yagaquot is comingIf I remember Parabellum correctly then John said he was an orphan of the Russian Gypsy so I am going assume based on that and the look on his face in the trailer when being told about his quotfamilyquot that hes a bastard that was thrown away as a babyyoung boy and therefore didnt know On top of that if I understood the trailer right it looks like hes going to have to survive through a night of assassins like in chapter so he can challenge what Im going to assume is his brother to a dawn duel But all that aside I would have gone to see this movie just so I could see Hiroyuki Sanada fight Yen ChitanNo filler just killer shitIve waited years for thisbrLets goooooooThis series is starting to give me James Bond vibesShame these movies went to shit after the first one sighThis man rewrote the definition of action movieI believe all us Asians are here for Donnie YenCame for Keanu stayed for DonnieEven the trailer music reminds the matrix trailer Its like the hollywood is trying to tell us quotsorry for that disaster matrix here is the real perfected versionquotSpoiler alertbrThe ending wont actually end and therell be a chapter But hey thats great newsMatrix revengeThis mf dont missPlease let this be the last one We dont need John wick part John goes to spaceACTINGSeasons In The Sun will be getting a boost in streamsThere is kmh speed limit in ParisSo excitedI think we jumped the shark with the last one but ill give it watch if its free somewherebrIm a little over all the Dance Dance Revolution fight scene choreographyI will be going to see it in MarchI remember like yesterday when The first one was out and i couldnt stop watching it Now its grown to be better than everIt took films to create a characterGood trailer and good choice of song for this one Also the cinematography is always striking to me in John Wick films

see ityear hiatus is definitely worth the wait for this treasure of nonstop combat actioni really want to like John Wickthe first film was a revelationbut the rd was upsetting because John is in the exact same spot at the end as he was at the beginningexcept a finger shortlike he fights the whole movie to get in front of the guy that can get him outthen for no real reason changes his mindbrbrAnd on top of that in the rd one the fight scenes were telegraphed to much and at points overly contrivedlike they are running around and fighting and somehow they end up in a knife and hatchet store or museum or somethingwhat are the oddsbrbrit just wasnt that goodexcept Mark Ducascoshe was funbrbrAnd the preview here with the stairs fight sceneit just looked odd like he is out in the open turning

type crazy story shitI mean i loved the first one it was a simple action story The second one was bigger in all directions maybe even better it explored Johns tragic backstory The third one however was a bit too long and kinda focused on other things than Johns character a his reason to fight a bit too much It was too long and some of the action didnt look as realistic as it used to especially towards the end It was also obvious that they are running out of ideas those dogs gor boring fast and all that And i am affraid this one will be a similar story a lot of insane action that went a bit too far from the plausible style of the original Like they are shooting at each other from two meters while holding a sword and nobody hits anythingYeehawJust love how he says quotIm gonna need a gunquotWhat the f Is that Donnie Im so hype cant wait to see the moviei feel like johnny silverhand will at one point be realCant act his way into a stolen election but he knows how to come with the

missingGoosebumpsSo he started by killing common criminals then killing elite assassins and now hes going to join the criminal elite Or die trying Im guessing the story has to end hereGave me chills fuckin hype manSo I have two theories The first one is that John Wick before the beginning of the first movie and what we are seeing is his travels through the Seven Rings of Hell til he reaches paradise and reunites with his wife I know sounds crazy but the movie does reference The Divine Comedy in subtle ways Second theory is that his wife was somehow connected to the underworld but they are holding back on the revealI love Keanu and I love the franchise but parabellum was so miserably bad and this doesnt look any different Im hoping my boy turns it aroundWith a fuckin pencilTruth be told felt really let down with his last Matrix film I mean what WAS poor Trinity doing reduced to a coffee house soccer mom for most of it mind you here we have both Mr Reeves AND Mr McShane can never decide who is the coolest in these movieslets fucking go i waited for it so longSo apparently John is friends with Winston again after he shot him a couple times and made him take like a story fall

holding there a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqEVUtrkBamptmsa cant tellA movie franchise that sticks to pure entertainment instead of acting as a platform for wokeism We need more of this back in HollywoodSome scenes look like a video gameMatthew Perry dislikes this movieThank god its next year Im not ready yetI really hope they keep making more of these Everyone new installment is as good as the lastDid anyone catch up with the quot I need gunsquotwhat the hell is that sword made out of also at the end of the movie can you edit it to where he gets a cat like NobodySeriously I love this franchise Cannot wait to see it in theatersBaba jagaLETS BE HONEST THIS LOOKS HORRIBLE I love john wick but each film gets worse and worse and this one looks uninteresting to say the least They are running out of ideas to make him look more of a badda Only so much you can do its hit its limit Horrible cast also its laughableHmm The first John Wick is my favorite movie and I also loved the other but they seem to keep moving toward absurd action rather than the more realistic gunfights and cqc of the first film Ill watch regardless but Id prefer they pulled back a little on the crazy duels and shitNow its getting a little sameyThis just in theyre gonna remake the whole movie but with Matthew Perry in Keanu Reeves placeThe thing about these movies is they nailed the world building part which makes writing stories easierEagerly waitingWick plus Mission Impossible next year already looking upEagerly waitingEagerly waitingI would love to see Chow YunFat in John Wick universeFaltou um John Wick aqui no BrasilHell yah Bill skarsgardEagerly waitingthis is what saves the new matrix been waiting for this movie so long cant wait to see this the fact Donnie yen is in it just makes this movie over the top thank youBruh u dont gotta do another oneEPIC Keanu EPIC and LEGENDARY John WickbrNever imagine that him family has sit at the tableIp man vs John WickThe mustang is backOh my gawdHis ideals may be purebut lets not forget what John Wick was before the I love the movies but I would like to see what made him into what he isto see the side of his world that would probably put to offif it is portrayed as it would be in the real world The people who do this for real are quite often completely deplorable and have no redeeming qualities at all But for entertainment its great Those things that were stolen while you were staying at a top hotel those kind of people inhabit this world and are not any where near as noble as John But the people they work for are even worse and u wont know who they are everDont get some romantic notion that the movies are how it truly is because if you read the news in any country on any day you will find that it is only the people at the top who keep it all and the rest of us scrounge for their table scraps I dont have anything against them other than romanticising something that impressionable minds might believe is a good way to make a living and life It aint period cause you will lose everything that is important and love That is the case for of people who choose a life like that It always ends in tears trust meWhen will you die Mr WickThis is the only movie even they release it ten times it wont fadeYYYYYEEEEEEeeeeeeeessssssssYessI cant wait to see this and hopefully Mr wick live on in this movieSame old ShitIn all honesty both Donnie Yen and Keanu Reeves seem like they dont age They just get better with time in my opinionLove me some john wick mans dog got murdered and he we got dope films soon to be gotta love itThe

say this trailer excited me for chapterSo I guess he just survived and recovered from that fallThis comes out on my birthday Im so excitedThese movies make absolutely no sense after the second one and Im being nice giving it that much then they couldve killed him at the end of and made it be a story about a man that met his end all because some shit head stole his car but NOOOOO here we are looking at the trailer for a FOURTH movie With all that being said Ill probably still watch it for the amazing fightsThey should have stopped after the firstPerfectLooks CGI up the wazoo but Ill watch ita

was the final film in the franchise but it could surely morph into a two part finale as well and Id be happy either wayI am waiting for a final hit of a franchise from Keanu which is Constantine Like JW the first movie was very good but not super duper on the other hand promised possible scenario combinations to enrich the story as a whole as well as the JW series Because Keanu stated that he liked Constantine so muchThe matrix sequel we deserveWick gt chuckPlot twist His wife is still aliveDonnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada finna help make this ANOTHER CLASSICthis looks so amazing im assuming

ballet over movies this looks the accumulation of all previous ones but while I am glad to return to this world I have the fear it may be just some shallow mumbo jumbo attempt at bringing more quotlorequot and new characters and story in ultimately missing the point of the series which is in principle aesthetic violence and lead to marvelification where each and every little side character will need their little spin off I hope I am wrong Let a series end in dignity so do not pull another matrix basically is what I am sayingI hope Winston doesnt die love his interactions with John brI

up late and still kills him or someone else does possibly the sisters ward who he left on the train with a knife in his chest and then hes executed honorably to finish the film I dont think he will

cut down the fight durations brbrPart is still the best John Wick movie was good was nonsenseThis should be John Wick Everyone remember the John Wick crossover with the MatrixThe story is getting too stretched out like jurassic park As much as Ive enjoyed the franchise I hope this is the last unless they find some actual new spin to it Also Donnie Yen is so out of place just a big name to attract audience but its losing the dark underground concept that was the first movie Theyre abusing too much the invulnerable suitCHILLS I AM SO EXCITEDLol they made Johnny silverhand irl and getting his own movieIf they kill off John Wick in this movie I will refuse to watch another Keanu reeves movie againThis series rocksHes gonna fuck themupSo this is going to be almost the only real good movie in the cinema in also because it will not have Woke or Identity Politics in itbrbrCant wait to see itCourt suits made only for Keanu ReevesI just realized Morphius is in theseMy favorite actorI dunno if Im so hooked after watching this trailerOmg fuckin FIANLLY I was beginning to lose hope we would see this next yearAs a NonAmericanwe only accept blunders or lame stunts as classy or genuine from Hollywood but if any other countrys movie industry made the same scene like the one of Keanu fighting Donniewe would have branded it as lame amp laughed it off amp especially labelled the director amp his action choreography team as dumbbrOn the other handseriouslyhow can you miss some one from pointblank rangeLets be honest john wick is the only movie we all have been waiting to come out a new parz even tho we ve seen of moviesfinallyNot enough big cats biting women in the crotchi camejust CANT WAITI thought Scott Adkins was supposed to be in this The best movie martial artist of his generation and not a single glimpse disappointingDonnie Yen looks so in that end fight Really looking forward to itso glad they are branching out and expanding the john wick universe to new parts of the globe I think exploring the crime scene of asian is a good move as they have such a deep and honorable way of crime there perfect paring for the john wick universeLooks like another epic John Wick movie and Im ok with Keanu Reeves making lots more of theseI havent said this in the last idk how many years I CANT WAIT TO SEE THISSeems just like yesterday when we saw John kill someone with a pencil and another with a book This franchise has really come a long waybrbrAnd this trailer looks so stunning Ive never really paid attention to much else except the fight choreography but the cinematography in this trailer is terrific The location shots really popbrbra hrefhttpwwwyoutubecomresultssearchqueryhypedhypedaCant wait John Wick is back babyIt looks very similar to the previous three films as far as cinematography and fight choreography which is great I just hope this is the conclusion to the story because I would hate for this great franchise to be dragged out just for financial gains Im really glad Keanu has had such a successful career as an actor Hes one of only a few that should be considered a role model in the businessSomeone know the musicI havent been this excited for a movie since John WickLet me guess Keanu is going to promote his motorcycle products hereSoooo Winston and John best buds again after being pushed off a high roof thenYes pleaseAnsioso

nicest and realistic guys in HollywoodWhy hasnt he killed Winston yetThe first movie had a token plot the rest are just two hours if a guy materializing weapons and ammo as he walks through crowds slaughtering incompetent thugs Does there need to be another Keanu Reeves is a talent far beyond this Im sure he finds it fun and rakes in big bucks but I would like to see him in more sophisticated

McCallquot from Equalizer to do a ONE AWESOME MOVIE together A storyline that combines both John Wick and Equalizer movieswhen keanu asks for gun a gun loaded of metro shouldve come into the scene that would be BOMBASTIC and matrix easter egg ofcHoly shit that looks goodAll I can hope is that you have the will necessary to commit to finishing this for good on a high note Dont get caught up in adding yourself to the pile of cinema mistakes dont pull a Taken dont try and pull a Supernatural or feel that John Wick should last forever Finish off with a legacy it can be proud ofHurry up cant wait Make it this ChristmasWere they playing GunZ at the end there wtfPuta madre espectacularSo winston is still an allyI recall seeing a John Wick trailer where he was in the snow useing a PU M What happened to thatEvery Asian In Hollywood Is Either A Creepy Logically Speaking Guy Or A Fucking NinjaOh wwnot a dig on keanu but I gotta be honest Im sick of the concept of bullet proof suit jackets with no real armor padding being held up in front of the bullets and not being knocked back or even moving from impactwhat the fuck is wrong with just regular body armorOf course Im going to watch the movieHope it dont end need more was waiting from a long time love from indiaGiving hitman vibes with the backgroundsJohn kills everyone hes babayagaThe baba yaga John wickIll be there to watch it as soon as it comes outI know bills gotta get paid but this Hiroyuki Sanada guya hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqEVUtrkBamptmsa quotwheres the ringquotthe question is when he told wick your family sits on the high table who is he talking aboutConstantine Whens that comingI could be wrong but at the a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqEVUtrkBamptmsa mark that looks like Chow Yun Fat That would be cool if he was making a cameoI hope they also continue with some prequels as well for this franchiseHes still up against the machines This is his blue pill version Neo Wick Two sides of his brain are fighting for dominance A brParallelogram of ForcesSANADA VS DONNIE awesome cant waitman i just cannot grasp the fact that this has become such a great franchise out of nowhere and become one of my favorites of all time so happy and excited to see the conclusion to john wickwhy is he talking like this again very woodenSo Winston betraying John was definitely planned right Like John was in on itImagine if in John wick bad guy will be actor of agent smithWick is a outstanding ass kicker but is humble to his coreDonnie Yen is a fucking legend in a John Wick film is a wet dream come trueHermosoHiroyuki Sanada quotThe last Samuraiquot love to see him in this franchiseSo is this gonna be like a Ill be home for Christmas trope but instead of home its the site of the duel And Skaarsgard sends every assassin after him to stop him from attendingLets just hope the writing is better than Chapter I respect Reeves too much to have them do another Matrix on himI feel bad for the people in the future that will never be able to experience that amazingly excited feeling we are blessed with when we see a new trailer for a new movie with Keanu Reeves brSure theyll be blessed to see the movies he has been and will be part of but theyll never have that feeling we get to enjoy leading up to his films brThey can have their flying cars Id take John Wick Chapter over them anytimeI cannot waitVery nice videoSeems like the plot revolves around him having a way out but the other guy sends all these assassins to stop him being there at sunset so he loses by default to be executed which he is already wanted for anywayThe Matrix reference was top tierIs Agent Smith gonna be in this oneMaybe notit feels like im watching the matrixAt and those my godI really need to get one of these custom guns that shoot without the slide movingor no recoilI still believe this universe is connected to the matrix universe Guns lots of gunsIts word god damn it Its quotits wordquot not quotits wordquotI need that bulletproof sport coatJohn is a man of focus commitment and sheer willCant wait this come out this franchiseGlad to see John wick hasnt been replaced by year old assassin Or better yet meet his demise

young rookie assassin with his own story like john wick climbing the pecking order of this underworld and making his name after this final movie would be sickMan Man Manthe chosen ONE is back again

as the next but how many movies can be done of him whacking every killer on the planetLooks awesomeFrom Neo to John Wick to Batman and back to John WickDont know how theyll top but if anyone can find

with donnie yen looks pretty good his movements are so fast you can definitely tell the difference between a martial artist and an actorJohn Wick is already dressed for their funeralPeople never learn You best not F with Denzel Washington Liam Neeson or Keanu You are going to get wreckedIts always great to see Neil and morbius togetherThis is the new Die Hard series for the new genone legend and each sequel gets better and better Keep it going Keanu Keanu as Ted Guitar Strings ROCK ONmy only objection is the use of nostalgia from the matrix with things like quotIm gonna need a gunquot its so cringe and kinda insulting to the original piece of art imoquotWin or lose Its a way outquot I really like that lineWhat is that gunso in the last scene they are shooting each other feet away and missing Some assassinwho do they show so much damn movie in the trailer that last fight scene could have been left out I hate new age media and movies so much they ruin e everything with a passionMy

carJohn Wick Chapter will also turn out to be The Matrix and will reset the entire Matrix story line into being a short part of a John Wick film where he spends lifetimes in a virtual reality machine while healing near death but then after Constantine comes out Johnny Mnemonic will come out and show that The Matrix AND John Wick and Constantine were all just simulations cause by a spontaneous AI developed in Johnnys overfilled cyberware brian interface Then Johnny Mnemonic will just be called Shadowrun and everything will have come full circle and life will be complete Cmon Keanu you can do

entire armies at this point yet the table people still go right next to him and goquotyou are gonna diequotas long as there is keanu i will watch but you put in all these other legends in i will watch legallyGOATHere I was depressed all we were getting was a John Wick spinoff and they come through with thisWhen did Joe Burrows find time to star in a movie while losing games for the BengalsHuh didnt know you only need to raise your arm to block bulletsFinally the film I have been waiting for so longowwwww cant waitWith the kid that plays IT Dude this is gonna be goodIm so hypedI am going to need a gun because thats how we solve all our problemsIve been waiting for literal YEARS for this I cant wait to watch itThis ladies and gentlemen is how a true badass trailer should beI thought Lawrence Fishbones character diedlmao they made Johny Silverhand a real personi wish they bring back yayan and eka from previous movie and helping john wickJohn Wick is more of The Matrix than The Matrix itselfPerhaps the one movie I WOULD pay to see It has potential but Im fearing hollywood will fuck it up and chances are this will be the final John Wick movie I guess we should enjoy it while it lastsTheory timebrbrWhen winston says quotyour familyquot I thinkbrJohn probably was an orphan so they put him away for safetybrhis family was really good at hiding that theyre in the underworldbrhe is not saying Johns family exactly but family as in his wifes family my theory since the beginning that she or her family are in the tablebrbrThank you for coming to my Ted talk all theories are welcomed on the commentsI sincerely hope the franchise comes to an end with this Cant envision anyone else in this character and sincerely hope there isnt a spinoff named quotThe Tablequot with an assassin trying to keep up the aura of John Wickquot quot quot quot quot quotI see a lot of comments talking about how the fight scenes are quotpushing the envelopequot even further but I would argue that this kind of stuff is how they did it back in the day in Hong Kong cinema Jackie Chan Jet Li Donnie Yen the way scenes like that were shot without a million cuts and a steady camera to show you how REAL their talent was John Wick for me is bringing that style back and its so good to seeKeanu reevesHere only for Rinaa hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqEVUtrkBamptmsa bluetooth trigger action hahahahI got goosebumps cant waitNobody believed the movie would go this far yet Keanu himself made it happensIts all cotton candy and gumdrops until Donnie Yen wants to beat you into next TuesdayThat Ted Theodore Logan sure did well for himselfNever since the Matrix has love and gunpowder been so eloquently and flawlessly combined quotIts like wiping your ass with silkquotWhat handgun was he using was it a CZ not surethe spoilers tho jesus why did i watch this trailerStop Keanu You are more than a expensive flashing images Leave this franchiseAfter seeing third movie at the cinema I was quite sure that I wouldnt have enough interest to see any more sequels even though I love the this series But after enough time I understood that my original opinion of the third movie was mostly based on the part with Halle Berry and all those action scenes with her which felt like those scenes were filmed when they just practiced the stunts Now with this movie we have some of my favorite Asian actors so I am really excited So take my money I am one of the first at the ticket booth when this comes outnot another oneNoicegarbagePlease release in Tamil languageLets goOnly Trailer gave this much

trailers Marvel got people used to their movies with lots of fireworks and little adrenalineHoly shit is that Donnie YenLets reminder ourselves that Keanu is and still does his own stunts mans

Daddy is coming againholy shitBig Daddy is coming againSENSATIONALBig Daddy is coming againAny actor that considers themselves an quotaction heroquot need to have the dedication and willingness to actually train like Keanu has for this franchiseBig Daddy is coming againThis looks visually amazingWhat if Keanu mistakenly dials Chuck Norris phone number Whos the one to hung up firstI remember
